8,Introduction to Biology,The nature and the organizational patterns of the living world,"In accordance with different criteria we can see a diversity among living organisms. Organisms are diverse based on size, shape, form and habitats.
•	Living organisms show a wide range of variation in size, shape, form and habitat.
•	Size —Bacteria—1um—5 um to Giant Sequoia (Giant Red Wood)— 100m
•	Shape —Organisms are diverse in shape, e.g: Cylindrical (earth worm), streamline
shape (birds, fish)
•	Form —Unicellular (Amoeba), multicellular (any plant or animal)
•	Habitat — Terrestrial (Rat), aquatic (Fish), arboreal (Loris), aerial (Birds)
Characteristics of organisms

In order to survive, each organism whether simple or complex must be able to perform certain functions. Following features are the characteristics of organisms.
(i) Order and organization
From molecular level to biosphere there is an order and organization in organisms to perform their biological activities efficiently. Lower-level components are organized in a methodical pattern in upper level to make it most efficient: plant leaf and human eyes.
(ii) Metabolism
The sum of all chemical activities taking place in an organism is its metabolism. It includes catabolic reactions and anabolic reactions.
(iii) Growth and development
All organisms begin their life as a single cell. During growth an irreversible increase in dry mass occurs, which is characterized only by the living. Irreversible changes that occur during the life span of an organism is development. Growth and development are two consequent processes that happen in the life span of organisms.
 (iv) Irritability and coordination
Irritability is the ability to respond to stimuli from both internal and external environment. Movement of organisms occurs as a result of irritability and coordination. In animals this happens as a result of coordinated efforts of nervous, hormonal, muscular and skeletal system.
(v) Adaptation
Adaptation is a peculiarity of structure, physiology or behavior that promotes the likelihood of an organism’s survival and reproduction in a particular environment. E.g: Sunken stomata in Xerophytes, Viviparity in some mangroves, Splayed out foot in camels.
(vi) Reproduction
Ability to produce offspring for continuous existence of species
(vii) Heredity & Evolution
Organisms have genes that pass from one generation to the next and control specific physiological, morphological and behavioral characters of organisms. Ability of organisms to change over time as a result of genetic modification is evolution Many non living entities may have one or more of these characteristics but not all of them e.g., crystals grow, waves move but only living organisms display all these characteristics simultaneously or at some point during their life cycle. By considering this it can be said that these are occurring in single celled organisms as well as highly complex organisms such as humans and Anthophytes (flowering plants).","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"

10,Chemical and cellular basis of life,Physical and chemical properties of water important for life,"Physical and chemical properties of water important for life
Water is a vital inorganic molecule; life could not exist on this planet without water. It is important due to following reasons,
1. Vital chemical constituent of living cell
2. Provides a biological medium for all organisms
Physical and chemical properties of water molecule provide the ability to render the vitality.
Water molecule is small, polar and angular molecule. Polarity is an uneven charge distribution within a molecule. In water molecule. oxygen atom is slightly negative, and hydrogen atom is slightly positive. Weak attractions between the slightly polar hydrogen atom of one water molecule and the slightly polar oxy gen atom of adjacent water molecule are known as hydrogen bonds. These hydrogen bonds play a major role
in maintaining all the properties of water. The properties of water arise due to the hydrogen bonds between different water molecules. When the water is in liquid form its H bonds are very fragile. H bonds form, break and reform with great frequency.
Physical properties of water. Four major properties of water to maintain life on earth
•	Cohesive behavior
•	Ability to moderate temperature
•	Expansion upon freezing
•	Versatility as a solvent
1. Cohesive behavior
Attraction between water molecules due to hydrogen bonding is known as cohesion. Attraction between water molecules and other substances are known as adhesion. Both of the above properties of water allow it to act as a transport medium. Due to cohesion between water molecules, water and dissolved substances such as minerals are transported as a continuous column through xylem against gravity. Adhesion between water molecules and cell walls also helps in conduction of water and dissolved substances. Water has a high surface tension. This ability is given to water molecules, due to cohesion between the water molecules. Therefore, in an aquatic system, upper surface water molecules are attracted by lower surface molecules and it forms a water film. Small insects e.g. water skaters can walk on the surface of a pond.
2. Ability to moderate temperature
Water can absorb or release a relatively high amount of heat energy by a slight change in its own temperature. Due to the high specific heat, water will function as thermal buffer in living system and
aquatic bodies during the temperature fluctuations on earth. Due to the high heat of vaporization, with the minimum loss of water an organism can release much heat energy. This helps the organisms to cool their body surface. e.g. Prevent from overheating. Evaporation of sweat from human skin helps to maintain the body temperature at constant level. Transpiration in plants helps to cool the plant body surface and prevent from becoming too warm in the sunlight.
3. Expansion upon freezing
Generally, in an increase in temperature of any substances, reduces their density and on the other hand, in a decrease in temperature increases their density. When the temperature of water falls below 4 °C, it begins to freeze and forms a crystalline lattice alled ice cubes. Water has the maximum density at 4°C. Hence, ice floats on the surface of water bodies. It is an important property of water in polar regions, where, organisms in aquatic bodies can survive during the winter.
4. Versatility as a solvent
This ability is given to water due to their polarity. Polar molecules (e.g. Glucose), ionic compounds (e.g. NaCl), molecules with both polar and ionic regions (e.g. lysozymes) can dissolve in water. Water molecules surround each of the solute molecules and form hydrogen bonds with them. Therefore, solubility of the solutes depends on polarity and not in their ionic nature.","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
11,Chemical and cellular basis of life,Carbohydrates,"Most abundant group of organic compound on earth is carbohydrates. Major elemental composition is C, H, and O. Hydrates of carbon contain the same proportion of H: O which equals to 2:1 as in water. General formula is C(H,O)_. Three major groups of carbohydrates are monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides. Generally carbohydrates include sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) and
polysaccharides.
Monosaccharides
The simplest form of carbohydrates having general molecular formula as (CH,O), are monosaccharide. The number of C atoms varies from 3-7. All monosaccharide are reducing sugars, water soluble and occur in crystalline form. According to the number of carbon atoms, they are named as;
•	3C- Triose e.g. Glyceraldehydes (Phosphoglyceraldehyde is a derivative of Triose)
•	4C- Tetroses. e.g. Erythrose (rare in nature)
•	5C- Pentoses. e.g. Ribose, Deoxyribose, Ribulose (RUBP is a derivative of ribulose)
•	6C- Hexoses e.g. Glucose, Fructose, Galactose
According to the type of carbonyl (Keto, aldo) group, they are classified as;
a. Aldoses-glucose, galactose
b. Ketoses-fructose

Disaccharides
They are sugars formed by joining two monosaccharides by a glycosidic bond.
Glycosidic bond is formed by removal of a water molecule from two adjacent monosaccharides by a condensation reaction. Water molecule is formed from OH group of one monosaccharide molecule and H from adjoining monosaccharide molecule.
Glucose + Glucose = Maltose + H,0
Glucose + fructose = Sucrose + H,0
Glucose + Galactose = Lactose + H,0
Maltose and lactose are reducing sugars and sucrose is a non-reducing sugar.

Polysaccharides
They are macromolecules and biopolymers. Polysaccharides are made up of few hundred to a few thousand monosaccharide subunits. They are non crystalline, water insoluble, and not considered as sugars.
Some polysaccharides act as storage components where others contribute to the structure of living organisms. Based on their function they are categorized as storage polysaccharides and structural polysaccharides.
•	Storage- Starch, Glycogen
•	Structural- Cellulose, Hemicellulose, Pectin
Based on their architecture they are categorized as
•	Linear forms- Cellulose, Amylose
•	Branched forms- Glycogen, Amylopectin, Hemicellulose
Functions of carbohydrates.
Monosaccharides
•	Energy source
•	Building blocks of disaccharides and polysaccharides (disaccharides such as maltose, sucrose and polysaccharides such as starch, glycogen)
•	Components of nucleotides (DNA, RNA)
Disaccharides
•	Storage sugar in milk- Lactose
•	Translocation in phloem —Sucrose
•	Storage sugar in sugarcane- Sucrose
Polysaccharides
a.) Storage polysaccharides-
•	starch stores glucose as energy source in plants and chlorophytes.
•	glycogen stores glucose as energy source in animals and fungi.
•	inulin stores fructose as energy source in Dahlia tubers.
b.) structural polysaccharides-
•	Cellulose in the cell walls of plants and chlorophytes.
•	Pectin in the middle lamella of plant tissues.
•	Hemicellulose in cell walls of plants.
•	Chitin in the cell walls of fungi and in exoskeleton in Arthropods.","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
12,Chemical and cellular basis of life,Lipids,"Lipids
•Diverse group of hydrophobic molecules
•Large biological molecules but not considered as polymers or macromolecules.
•Consist of C, H, O and H:0 ratio is not 2:1. Comparatively more H than O are
present.
•Biologically important types of lipids: Fats, Phospholipids and Steroids.
Fats
Fats are made up of glycerol and fatty acids; Glycerol belongs to alcohol group having 3 carbons where each of them bear single hydroxyl group. Fatty acids are hydrocarbon chains with long (usually 16-18) carbon skeleton with a carboxyl group at its one terminal. Fatty acid molecules bind to each hydroxyl group of glycerol by ester bond. The resulting fat molecules are called as triacylglycerol (triglycerides). Hydrocarbon chains of fatty acids contribute to the hydrophobic nature of the fats. Based on the nature of hydrocarbon chains of fatty acids, they are categorized as
a) Saturated fats- made up of saturated fatty acids with hydrocarbon chains having no double bonds. Usually animal fats come under this category. They are mostly solid at room temperature. e.g: butter
b) Unsaturated fats- made up of unsaturated fatty acids with hydrocarbon chains having one or more double bonds. Usually plant fats come under this category. They are mostly liquid in room temperature. e.g: vegetable oils.
Unsaturated fats are classified based on the nature of their double bonds. a) Cisunsaturated fat b) Transunsaturated fat
Consumption of excess saturated fats and trans unsaturated fats contribute arthrosclerosis.

Phospholipids

Phospholipids are major components of cell membranes. They are composed of two fatty acids and one phosphate group attached to one glycerol molecule. The phosphate group gives the negative electrical charge to the phospholipid molecule. Typically, an additional polar molecule or small charged molecule is also linked to the phosphate group e.g. choline. The two ends of the phospholipids show different behavior. The hydrocarbon tails are hydrophobic while phosphate group and its attachment (head) are hydrophilic.

Functions of Lipids
•food reserve as energy source (triacylglycerols such as fats and oils)
•maintain the fluidity of plasma membrane (phospholipids, cholesterol)
•act as signaling molecules (eg. Hormones) that travel through the body
•found as components of cell membranes (phospholipids, cholesterol)","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
13,Chemical and cellular basis of life,Proteins,"Proteins
Proteins are made up of amino acids. Twenty different amino acids are involved in the formation of proteins. Elemental composition is C, H,O,N and S. At the center of the amino acid there is an asymmetric carbon atom except in glycine. In addition to this, each amino acid is composed of an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom and a variable group symbolized by R. In the case of glycine R is replaced by H atom. The R group also called the ‘side chain’ differs with each amino acid whereas the other groups are in the ‘back bone’ (including the H atom). Amino acids may have one or more carboxyl groups and amino groups. Amino group has alkaline nature and carboxyl group has acidic nature. When both characteristics are found in one molecule they are known as amphoteric molecules. Therefore, amino acids are amphoteric. Two Amino acids undergo condensation reaction by removing a water molecule, and result a bond known as peptide bond; OH from one amino acid and H from the other amino acid forms the water molecule. Protein is composed of one or more polypeptide chains which are composed of amino acids.

Levels of protein structures
There are four levels of structure which play important roles in their functions;
a) Primary structure
The unique sequence of linearly arranged amino acids linked by peptide bonds is the primary structure of proteins.
b). Secondary structure
The primary structure of a single polypeptide chain coils and folds, as a result of intra molecular hydrogen bonds between the oxygen atoms of the carboxy! groups and the hydrogen atoms of the amino groups, of the same polypeptide chain backbone, to form the secondary structure. There are two types of secondary structures.
•Alpha helix- e.g.Keratin.
•Beta pleated sheet e.g.spider’s silk fiber
b) Tertiary structure
Usually the secondary polypeptide chain bends and folds extensively forming a precise compact unique, functional and three-dimensional shape resulting from following interactions between the side chain/ R-group of amino acids;
•H bonds
•Disulphide bonds
•Tonic bonds
•Hydrophobic interactions and Van der Waals interactions e.g.most of the enzymes, myoglobin, albumin
c) Quaternary structure
Aggregation of two or more polypeptide chains involve in the formation of one functional protein. Separate chains are called protein subunits which were held together by inter and intra-molecular interactions.
e.g. Hemoglobin, Collagen

Denaturation of protein is the loss of specific three-dimensional shape due to the alteration of weak chemical bonds and interactions.
Agents affecting denaturation
1. High temperature and high energy radiation
2. Strong acids, alkaline and high concentrations of salts
3. Heavy metals
4 . Organic solvents and detergents

14,Chemical and cellular basis of life,Nucleic acids ,"Nucleic acids are Polymers exist as polynucleotides made up of monomers called nucleotides. They contain C, H, O, N and P. Nucleic acids are macromolecules, biopolymers. There are two types of Nucleic acids: DNA (Deoxyribo nucleic acids) and RNA (Ribonucleic acids).
Structure of nucleotides
Nucleotides have 3 components; namely pentose sugar, nitrogenous base and a phosphate group. A nucleotide without a phosphate group is called a nucleoside.e.g. Adenosine, Guanosine.
Pentose sugar
Pentose sugars are two types: namely Deoxy ribose and ribose (in deoxyribose one oxygen atom is less than in ribose)
Nitrogenous bases
There are two major groups of nitrogenous bases:
1. Purines- larger in size with two rings
2. Pyrimidines- smaller in size with a single ring
In purines there are two types; namely Adenine, Guanine. In pyrimidens there are threetypes, Thyamine, Uracil and Cytocine. Bases are commonly represented by letters A, G, T, U and C respectively.
Phosphate group
It gives the nucleic acids the acidic nature.

Formation of nucleic acids
Millions of nucleotides join by phospho-di-ester bond to form polynucleotide chains by condensation between the -OH group of the phosphate of one nucleotide and the -OH attached to 3 carbon of pentose sugar of the other. These bonds result in a backbone with a repeating pattern of sugar phosphate units. Nucleic acids are linear polymers of nucleotides. There are two kinds of nucleic acids depending on the type of the sugar molecules involved. If the sugar molecule in the nucleotide is deoxyribose, the nucleic acid is (DNA). If the pentose sugar is ribose, then the nucleic acid is RNA. DNA contains Adenine, Thymine, Guanine and Cytosine and RNA contains Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine and Uracil.
Structure of DNA molecule (Watson and Crick model)

DNA molecules have two anti-parallel polynucleotide chains that spiral around an imaginary axis, forming a double helix. The two sugar-phosphate backbones run in opposite directions from each other, and the arrangement is referred to as anti-parallel. The sugar phosphate backbones are on the outside of the helix, and the nitrogenous bases are paired in the interior of the helix. The two strands are held together by
hydrogen bonds between the paired nitrogen bases.
Base pair rule.
 Always a purine base, pairs with a specific, pyrimidine base,
A=T (2 hydrogen bonds)
G=C (3 hydrogen bonds)
Functions of DNA
•Store and transmit genetic information from one generation to the next generation
•Store the genetic information for protein synthesis
Structure of RNA
This is normally a single stranded nucleic acid composed of ribo-nucleotides containing bases, Uracil (U), Cytosine (C ), Guanine (G), Adenine (A). Complementary base pairing between two RNA molecules or within the same molecule may occur in some. Complementary base pairing facilitates three dimensional shapes essential for their functioning. Adenine binds with Uracil with two hydrogen bonds and Guanine binds
with Cytosine with three hydrogen bonds. There are three types of RNA present in cells,
1. Messenger RNA (mRNA)
2. Transfer RNA (tRNA)
3. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)

1.Messenger RNA
Messenger RNA is a linear molecule and is the least abundant type of RNA in a cells comparatively. There are two functions;
•Copies the genetic information stored in DNA molecule as a sequence of nitrogenous bases.
•Transports genetic information from nucleoplasm to the site of protein synthesis (ribosome) through nucleopores
2. Transfer RNA (tRNA)
Smallest RNA molecule. Linear, but forms three- looped structure.
3. Ribosomal RNA
It is the most abundant type of RNA. rRNA has a complex irregular structure. It provides the site where polypeptide chains are assembled.
Differences between DNA and RNA
1. DNA is double stranded molecule while RNA is a single stranded molecule.
2. DNA consists of A, T, G and C and absence of U, while RNA consists of AU, G and C and absence of T
3. The sugar molecule in RNA is ribose, while in DNA it is deoxyribose.

15,Chemical and cellular basis of life,Contribution of microscope to the expansion of knowledge on cells and cellular organization,"Advancement of cytology is mostly based on the microscopy. The discovery and early study of cells progressed with the invention of microscope.
Light microscope
Visible light is passed through the specimen and then through glass lenses. The lenses refract the light in such a way that the image of the specimen is magnified as it is projected into the eye. The simplest microscope is a single lens.
The compound light microscope
Compound light microscopes are commonly used in school laboratories, and it is used in medical laboratories as a diagnostic tool. Resolution power and magnification are important parameters which can be seen in a
microscope. Magnification is the ratio of an object’s image size to its actual size. Usually, the maximum
magnification of light microscope is 1000 times the actual size of the specimen) Resolution power is minimum distance between two points that can be distinguished as separate points (resolution power of light microscope is 0.2um). It is a measure of the clarity of the image. Magnification is limited due to the resolution. Light from an object (specimen on the slide) passes first through objective lens. Then
produce a magnified image. The total magnification is hence the product of the magnification of each lens.
Total magnification = Magnification of objective lens x Magnification of eye piece.
The Electron Microscope
The limitation imposed upon the resolution power of the light microscope by the wavelength of light. The resolution power is inversely proportional to the wavelength. Due to this, scientists considered the use of other forms of radiations with comparatively shorter wavelengths. As a result, electron microscopes were developed. In electron microscopy, a beam of electrons is focused through the specimen or on to its surface.
In practice, electron microscope magnifies about 5*105 times with a resolution about 2 nm. Electron microscopes have revealed many organelles and other sub cellular structures those were impossible resolve with the light microscopes. There are two types of electron microscopes.
1. Transmission electron microscopes (TEM)
2. Scanning electron microscopes (SEM)

Transmission electron microscopes
It is used to study the internal structures of cells. In this microscope, a beam of electrons is passed through a thin, especially prepared slice of material. A very thin specimen is used. Specimens stained with heavy metals which attach more to certain cellular structures than other areas. Image reflects the pattern of electrons passed through the specimen, displays on a screen. While electrons pass through the specimen, more
electrons may get displayed in regions where structures were densely stained.

Scanning electron microscopes
In this instrument, a fine beam of electrons is reflected from the surface of specimen. Specimen is mostly coated with gold prior to observation. Here the specimen scatters many electrons whereas others are absorbed. This instrument is ideal to observe the surface view in three dimensional appearances.

Differences between light and electron microscope.

Light microscopes and electron microscopes differ significantly in their design and functionality. In a light microscope, glass lenses are used to focus light rays, enabling the image to be directly detected by the naked eye. Both living and non-living objects can be observed using a light microscope, and the actual color of the object can be seen. Dyes are commonly used to stain the objects being examined for better visualization.

In contrast, an electron microscope uses powerful magnets to focus a beam of electrons, producing images that cannot be directly detected by the naked eye. Instead, micrographs are produced to view the specimen. Electron microscopes are limited to observing non-living objects, as the process requires conditions that are not conducive to living specimens. Additionally, the actual color of the object cannot be observed, and images are artificially developed. Heavy metals are used to stain the objects in electron microscopy for enhanced contrast and detail.","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
16,Chemical and cellular basis of life,"Historical background of the cell and analyses the structure and
functions of the sub cellular units","Cell theory

All organisms are composed of cells.
Recall the hierarchy of life, the levels of organization mentioned earlier. The basic
unit which can be called “living” is the cell, which may form a single celled organism
(e.g.Chlamydomonas, Yeast) or a multi-cellular plant or animal. The cell is the basic
structural and functional unit of life.
The level of organization of matter represented by a cell shows all the characteristics
of life. Any stage below level of a cell cannot be considered living, whether it is a
single celled organism or multi-cellular plant or an animal.
Robert Hooke (1665) examined a cork using simple microscope and gave the term
“CELL” to describe the basic units.
Anton Van Leeuwenhook (1650), a contemporary of Robert Hooke, was the fi rst to
describe and record living single celled organisms, Euglena & bacteria
Matthias Schleiden (1831), a botanist, studying plant tissues concluded that all plants
are made up of cells.
Theodore Schwann a zoologist (1839) concluded that animal tissues are also made up
of cells.

Rudolf Virchow (1855) showed that all cells arise from pre-existing cells by cell
division,
Schleiden, Schwann and Virchow presented the ‘Cell Theory’ which included the
following.
1.All organisms are composed of one or more cells.
2.The basic structural and functional unit of organisms is the cell.
3.All cells arise from pre-existing cells.
Organization of cells
There are two kinds of cellular organization - Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic
All cells share certain basic features. They are;
• All cells are bounded by a plasma membrane which is a selective barrier
• Within the cell have, a semifl uid, jelly like substance which is called cytosol.
Subcellular components are suspended within the cytosol.
• They carry DNA as genetic materials.
• Ribosomes are found in all cells

The differences between Prokaryotic cells and Eukaryotic cells.

Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells differ in several key aspects. Prokaryotic organisms include bacteria and archaebacteria, while eukaryotic organisms encompass protists, fungi, plants, and animals. Prokaryotic cells are generally smaller, with a diameter of 1-5µm, whereas eukaryotic cells range from 10µm to 100µm in diameter. Prokaryotes are mainly unicellular, while eukaryotes are primarily multicellular, although some protists and fungi can be unicellular. Evolutionarily, prokaryotes appeared around 3.5 billion years ago, whereas eukaryotes evolved 1.8 billion years ago from prokaryotes.

Cell division in prokaryotes occurs via binary fission, without mitosis or meiosis, while eukaryotes divide through mitosis, meiosis, or both. Prokaryotic genetic material consists of circular DNA that is free in the cytoplasm, in a region called the nucleoid, and is not associated with proteins. In contrast, eukaryotic DNA is linear, contained within a nucleus, and associated with proteins. Prokaryotes have 70s ribosomes, which are smaller, while eukaryotes possess both 70s ribosomes (in mitochondria and chloroplasts) and 80s ribosomes, with the latter sometimes attached to the endoplasmic reticulum.

Prokaryotic cells have few organelles, none of which are membrane-bound, and internal membranes are sparse, often associated with processes like respiration, photosynthesis, and nitrogen fixation. Eukaryotic cells, on the other hand, are rich in membrane-bound organelles, including the nucleus, mitochondria, and chloroplasts (each with double membranes), as well as lysosomes and vacuoles (with single membranes). The cell walls of prokaryotes differ depending on the organism, with bacteria having peptidoglycan, while archaebacteria have polysaccharides and proteins. In eukaryotes, plant cells have cellulose in their cell walls, while fungi have chitin, and animal cells lack cell walls.

Flagella in prokaryotes are simple, lacking microtubules, and exist extracellularly with a diameter of about 20nm. In eukaryotes, flagella are more complex, with a ‘9+2’ arrangement of microtubules, and are intracellular, with a larger diameter of 200nm. Prokaryotes typically rely on mesosomes for respiration, while eukaryotes use mitochondria for aerobic respiration. Photosynthesis in prokaryotes occurs on membranes that are not stacked, whereas eukaryotic cells contain chloroplasts with stacked membranes organized into lamellae or grana. Finally, while some prokaryotes can fix nitrogen, eukaryotes lack this ability.","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
18,Chemical and cellular basis of life,"Structures and functions of organelles and other subcellular components
Plasma membrane: ","Plasmamembrane is the outer limit of cytoplasm. All cellular membranes resemble the ultra structure of plasma membrane. In 1972, Singer and Nicolson put forward the fluid mosaic model of cell membrane. It is mainly composed of;
• Phospholipids (most abundant type of lipid in plasma membrane)
• Protein
The Plasma membrane has the following features. It is about 7nm thick. It is mainly made up of a phospholipid bilayer. Phospholipids are amphipathic molecules. The hydrophilic heads of the phospholipids face outwards into the aqueous environment of both inside and outside of the cell. The hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails face inwards and create a hydrophobic interior. Plasmamembrane is compared to the fluid mosaic model. Since phospholipid molecules are moveable, they provide the fluid nature to the membrane.
Protein molecules embedded randomly contribute to its mosaic nature. Some of the protein molecules penetrate all the way through the membrane, called transmembrane proteins and some others penetrate only part of the way into the membrane. These are called integral proteins.

Some proteins and lipids have short branching carbohydrate chains like antennae, forming glycoprotein and glycolipids, respectively. Animal’s cell membrane may contain few cholesterol molecules randomly integrated into the lipid bilayer. These cholesterol molecules provide flexibility and stability to the membrane
by reducing membrane fluidity at moderate temperatures and prevent membrane solidification at low temperatures. The two sides of the membrane may differ in composition and function

Functions
• The plasma membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of living cell physically separating the intracellular components from the extracellular environment.
• Plasma membrane is selectively permeable and able to regulate the exchange of material needed for survival.
• Proteins embedded in the plasma membrane identify the cell, enabling nearby cells to communicate with each other (involved in cell recognition).
• Some protein molecules act as receptor molecules for interacting with specific biochemical, such as hormones, neurotransmitters and immune proteins.
• Some proteins in the cell membrane attach to some cytoskeletal fibers and help to maintain the shape of the cell.
• Some proteins in the membrane act as enzymes. (e.g.Microvillus on epithelial cell lining of some parts of the gut contains digestive enzymes in their cell
surface membrane.)","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"

• Nuclear envelope- composed of two membranes, inner and outer membranes, separated by a space of 20-40 nm. Nuclear envelope is perforated by nuclear pores which has pore complex to regulate the entry and exit of substances. It has nuclear lamina, made up of protein fi laments which line the interior side of the nuclear envelope.
• Nuclear matrix is made up of protein fi laments and extended throughout the interior of the nucleus. Chromatin and nucleolus are embedded in the nuclear matrix.
• Nucleolus- appears as darkly stained granules with fi bers adjoining part of the chromatin.
• Chromatin –appears as a diffused mass in electron micrographs of non dividing cells. It is a complex of DNA and proteins. During nuclear divisions, chromatin condenses, tightly coils and form threads, called chromosomes. Each species has a constant number of chromosomes. (e.g. typical human cell has 46
chromosomes).

Functions
• Control all cellular activities.
• Synthesize DNA to produce new nuclei for cell divisions.
• Synthesize rRNAs and ribosomal subunits required for protein synthesis, through nucleolus.
• Synthesize mRNA and tRNA according to the information present on the DNA.
• Store and transport genetic information

Ribosomes
These are subcellular components which carryout protein synthesis. They consist of two subunits; larger subunit and smaller subunit. They are composed of rRNA and protein. Ribosomes are found in two types; 70S and 80S. 70S ribosomes are found freely on the cytoplasam of prokaryotes, matrix of mitochondria and stroma of chloroplasts. 80S ribosomes are found only in eukaryotes. Based on the nature of presence, 80S
ribosomes are categorized as two types; free ribosomes and bound ribosomes. Free ribosomes: freely available as group in cytoplasam. Bound ribosomes are attached to the membrane surface of rough endoplasmic reticulum.

Functions
Protein synthesis

Endoplasmic reticulum
It is a network of internal membranes forming flattened or tubular sacs separating cytosol from ER lumen. It is continuous with the outer membrane of nuclear envelope. There are two types of ER; Rough ER and Smooth ER

Rough ER
Rough ER consists of flattened sacs, and ribosomes bound to surface. Proteins
synthesized by ribosomes move into lumen of ER.
Functions
• Transport protein synthesized by ribosomes
• Synthesizing glycoproteins
• Produce transport vesicles
• Facilitate the growth of own membrane by adding phospholipids proteins and
carbohydrates. Therefore called as membrane factory

Smooth ER
Smooth ER is a network of tubular sacs without ribosomes. Membrane bound enzymes
are present.
Functions
• It synthesizes lipids including oils, steroids and phospholipids.
• Metabolism of carbohydrates.
• Produce transport vesicles to transport within cell.
• Involves in detoxification.
• Stores Ca2+ ions.

Golgi apparatus

Golgi apparatus is a stacks of fl attened sacs or Cisternae. Inner and outer surfaces can be identifi ed as cis face and transface respectively. Cis face is located near the E.R to receive vessicles from E.R. Trans face give rise to secretory vessicles which budded off and travel other side. Golgi complex is abundant in secretory cells.
Functions
• Collecting, packaging and distribution of materials
• Manufacturing cellulose and non cellulose cell wall components such as pectin
• Produce lysosomes

Lysosomes
They are single membrane bounded vesicles contributing to digestive activity. They contain hydrolytic enzymes which catalyze breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids.

Functions
• Digest food particles received by phagocytosis
• Transport residue material out of cell by exocytosis.
• Digest worn out organelles
• Autolysis causing cell death.

Peroxisome
They are single membrane bounded vesicles with oxidizing enzymes.They are present in both plants and animals. Enzymes in peroxysome catalyze the breakdown of H2O2.

Functions
• Detoxification of peroxides
• Photorespiration in plants Specialized peroxysomes called glyoxysomes are found in fat storing tissues in plants. Glyoxysomes converts fatty acids into sugar.

Mitochondria
It is one of the most common organelles in eukaryotic cells. It is an elongated organelle with two enclosing membranes. Outer membrane is smooth but the inner membrane is convoluted to form cristae. Cristae increase the surface area and they contain stalk particles. The gap/space in between inner and outer membranes of the mitochondrion is called intermembrane space. The inner most part of the organelle
is known as mitochondrial matrix, which consists of 70 s ribosomes circular DNA.

Chloroplast
It is a biconvex lens shaped organelle with two membranes which is found in plants and some protists. The outer and inner membranes are smooth and are separated by a very narrow intermembrane space. Inside the chloroplast there is another membrane system. This membrane produces flattened and interconnected sacks called thylakoids. Thylakoids contain complexes called photosystems which are made up of photosynthetic pigments. Thylakoids stacked to form a granum. The grana are interconnected by inter
granal lamellae. The fluid outside the thylakoid is stroma which contain circular DNA (chloroplast DNA), 70s ribosomes, many enzymes, starch granules and lipid droplets.

Functions
• Photosynthesis
Cytoskeleton
Cytoskeleton is the supporting structure of the cell and maintains its shape. It is more important for animal cells which lack cell walls. Cytoskeleton is made out of microtubules and protein fi laments. Additionally, it is Dynamic hence, has the ability to break and reform as needed. There are three types of components in the Cytoskeleton as follows;
• Microtubules
• Actin fi laments or Microfilaments,
• Intermediate fi laments

Differences between Microtubules, Microfilaments laments and intermediate filaments

Microtubules are hollow tubes, with their walls consisting of 13 columns of tubulin molecules. The protein subunits are tubulin, and their main functions include maintaining cell shape, enabling cell motility (such as in cilia or flagella), chromosome movements during cell division, and organelle movements.
Microfilaments, or actin filaments, consist of two intertwined strands of actin, each of which is a polymer of actin subunits. Their functions include maintaining cell shape by bearing tension, facilitating changes in cell shape, enabling muscle contraction, aiding cytoplasmic streaming in plant cells, contributing to cell motility (such as in pseudopodia), and assisting in cell division in animal cells through the formation of the cleavage furrow.
Intermediate filaments are composed of fibrous proteins that are supercoiled into thicker cables. The protein subunits vary depending on the cell type, with keratin being one example. Intermediate filaments primarily maintain cell shape by bearing tension, anchor the nucleus and certain other organelles, and form the nuclear lamina.
Functions
• Provide strength to the cytoplasm
• Anchorage organelles and cytosolic enzymes of the cell
• Movement of cytoplasm, cytoplasmic streaming, positioned organelles and
move chromosomes when necessary.
• Maintain the shape of the cell (mainly in animal cells)

Cilia and Flagella
Cilia and flagella share a common structure. Flagella are long elongated structures and Cilia are short cellular projections that are often organized in rows. Cilia are more numerous than flagella on the cell surface. They are made of microtubules, with a 9+2 structure (Nine doublets of microtubules are arranged in a ring, with two single microtubules in its center). They are covered by plasma membrane and bound to a basal body which anchors the cilium or flagellum to the cell. The Basal body has 9 + 0 arrangement (no microtubules in its center)
Functions
• Act as locomotor appendages
• Can move fluid over the surface of the tissue
• Cilia lining in oviducts help move an egg toward the uterus

Centrioles
Centriole is made up of cylindrically arranged microtubules which are non membrane bounded subcellular component present only in animal cells. Each centriole composed of nine sets of triplet microtubules arranged in a ring (9+0). A pair of centrioles which arranged perpendicular to each other are located in a region called centrosome near the nucleus.
Functions
• Produce aster and spindle in cell division.

Central Vacuole
Central vacuole is a large structure, bound by tonoplast, filled with liquid called cell sap found in plant cells. The composition of sap differs from cytosol and it contains water, ions such as Potassium and Chloride and sometimes water soluble colored pigments such as anthocyanin.
Functions
• Stores water and other materials such as sugars, ions and pigments.
• Maintains water balance of the cell
• Gives turgidity and support to cell.
• Produce colours in some plants with sap pigments
• Stores soluble substances needed for cellular activities.","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
20,Chemical and cellular basis of life,Extracellular components ,"1. Cell wall
Cell wall is an extracellular structure of plant cells. Animal cells do not have cell walls. However, prokaryotes, fungi and some protists also have a thin and flexible cell wall. The chemical composition of the wall greatly varies from species to species and even from one cell type to another even in the same plant. Nevertheless in Plants, cell wall is generally made up of cellulose, pectin, hemicellulose, lignin and suberin (in some
plant cells only). Plants generate two types of cell walls: primary and secondary walls. Young cells first secrete primary cell wall: it is the wall laid down during plant cell division. Just outside the primary wall there is a thin layer (middle lamella) which is rich in sticky polysaccharides called pectins (magnesium and calcium pectate). Middle lamella glues adjacent cells together. Due to the deposition of hardening substances on the
primary wall a secondary cell wall is generated secondarily. Primary cell wall is permeable, relatively thin, flexible, composed mainly of cellulose fibers which are laid unevenly running through the extracellular matrix (middle lamella) Water can move freely through the free spaces of cell wall Secondary cell wall lies between plasma membrane and primary cell wall. It contains several layers of hard materials, forming a rigid structure. In addition to cellulose, impermeable substances such as lignin and suberine are also incorporated in to the
secondary wall. Lignin cement anchors cellulose fibers together providing hard and rigid matrix, giving the cell wall an extra support.

Cell wall has pits through which cytoplasm of adjoining cells join through plasmodesmata.
Functions
• Protection and support
• Allows development of turgidity when water enters the cell
• Prevents bursting during turgidity
• Limits and control cell growth
• Component of appoplast pathway
• Maintaining cell shape
• hold the plant up against the force of gravity
2. Cell junctions
Cell junctions are structures at which neighbouring plasma membranes are joined.
They are also interact and communicate via sites of direct physical contacts.

Functions
• Connects the internal chemical environment of adjacent cells.
• Cell junctions are structures at which cytoplasm of adjoining cells are joined.

There are three types of cell junctions in animal cells
• Tight junctions – connect the plasma membranes of adjacent cells tightly bound by specific proteins forming continuous seals around the cells. Prevent leakages of extracellular fluids through intercellular space. e.g. skin epithelium
• Desmosomes/Anchor junctions – mechanically attach the cytoskeletons of
adjoining cells by intermediate fi laments for strong binding. e.g. muscle tissue
• Gap junctions /Communicating junctions – provide cytoplasmic channels
from one cell to an adjescent cell. Gap junctions consists of special membrane
proteins that surround the pore through which ions, sugars amino acids may
pass. They allow signal and material exchange between adjacent cells through
direct connections. E.g. heart muscles, animal embryo.

Plasmodesmata
• Microscopic channels which runs through plant cell walls. They are cytoplasmic
living connections between cytoplasm of adjoining cells. These are membrane
lined channels filled with cytoplasm 

Extracellular matrix of animal cells
Although animal cells lack cell walls they do have elaborate extracellular matrix
(ECM). Main components of the ECM are glycoproteins and other carbohydrates
containing molecules secreted by the cells. Most abundant glycoprotein in the ECM of
most animal cell is collagen which forms strong fibres outside the cell. The collagen
fibres are embedded in a network woven out of proteoglycan secreted by cells.
Functions
• Forms a protective layer over the cell surface
• Linking extra cellular matrix and cytoskeleton.
• Influences the cell behavior by Involving in the mechanical and chemical
signaling. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
21,Chemical and cellular basis of life,The cell cycle and the process of cell division,"The sequence of events that takes place in the cell from the end of one cell division
to the end of the next cell division is referred to as cell cycle. At the end of the cell
division, two genetically identical daughter cells resembling the parent cell are
produced in mitosis. 

Eukaryotic cell cycle
Mitosis
Eukaryotic cell cycle may divide into two major phases.
• Interphase
• Mitotic phase/ M-phase
Interphase is the longer phase of cell division. It covers about 90% of the cell cycle.
Interphase could be divided into three phases;

• G
1 phase (first gap phase)
• S phase (synthetic phase)
• G
2 phase (second gap phase)
G1 phase
In this phase synthesis of proteins and production of cellular organelles leading to cell
growth occur. Proteins essential for S phase are produced during this phase.
S phase
DNA replication occurs and synthesis of histone proteins takes place. DNA wind
around histone beads and form chromatin.
G
2 phase
Cells continue to grow through protein synthesis as well as cellular organelles. Proteins
essential for mitotic phase will be synthesized. Duplication of centrosomes takes place.
There are cell cycle-controlling checkpoints available at G1, G2 and M phases to ensure
that the cell is ready for moving into upcoming phases of cell division. Some cells
receive a go-head signal at the G1 check point, it will usually complete the G1, S, G2
and M phases and divide. If it does not receive a go head signal at that point it may exit
the cycle, entering into a non dividing stage called the Go phase. The most cells of the
human body are actually in the Go phase. e.g. nerve cells and muscle cells.
Mitotic phase/ M phase
M phase covers only about 10% of cell cycle. This includes mitosis and cytokinesis.
Mitosis
Mitosis is referred to the nuclear division which gives rise to two genetically identical
daughter nuclei from a mother nucleus. This may get divided into five stages; prophase,
prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase in order to ease the learning of
activities of cell cycle. 

1. Prophase
Chromatin fibers get condensed by shortening and thickening and transformed into
chromosomes. As a result chromosomes will be visible through light microscope.
Nucleoli get disappeared and chromosomes appear with two sister chromatids attached
at the centromere. Chromosomal arms of sister chromatids attached by special proteins
called cohesion. The formation of mitotic spindles begins. Spindle includes the
centrosomes, the spindle microtubules and the aster.
Centrosomes move toward opposite poles of the cell due to the lengthening of
microtubules between them.
2. Prometaphase
The nuclear envelope fragments. Chromosomes get even more condensed. A special
protein called kinetochore attaches the sister chromatids of each chromosome at their
centromere. Some of the microtubules that attach to the kinetochore of the chromosomes
move the chromosomes back and forth. Microtubules which are not attached to the
kinetochore interact with those from the opposite poles.
3. Metaphase
Centrosomes reach the opposite poles. The chromosomes have arrived to a place called
metaphase plate which is located in equal distance from each pole. The centromeres
of all chromosomes are located in the metaphase plate. At the end of this phase, each
chromosome of the cell get attached to the kinetochore microtubule at their centromere
and aligned at the metaphase plate.
4. Anaphase
Sister chromatids are separated at the centromere. Microtubules attached to kinetochore
get shorten and pull sister chromatids towards the opposite poles. Cell elongates as
the non kinetochore microtubules are lengthen. By the end of anaphase equal and
complete set of chromosomes found at each pole of the cell.
5. Telophase
Nuclear envelope reforms around each set of chromosomes at opposite poles. Nucleoli
reappears. Spindle microtubules get deplolymerized. Chromosomes unwind and
become less condense to form chromatin. Two genetically identical daughter nuclei
are formed.
Cytokinesis
The division of the cytoplasam starts at the end of the telophase. Therefore at the end
of the mitosis two genetically identical daughter cells are produced.
In animal cells- a cleavage furrow forms. This produces two genetically identical
daughter cells. 

In plant cells- cell plate forms as a result of vesicle produced by golgi apparatus. This
divides the cytoplasm in to two and generates two genetically identical daughter cells
to the parent cell.
Significances of mitosis
1. Maintains the genetic stability
2. Growth and development
3. Cell repair, replacement and regeneration
4. Asexual reproduction ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
22,Chemical and cellular basis of life,Meiosis,"Sexually reproducing organisms undergo different type of cell division called meiosis.
Meiosis
Meiosis is a type of nuclear division which gives rise to four haploid, genetically non
identical daughter nuclei, from a diploid mother nucleus.
Meiosis involves two consecutive nuclear divisions, Meiosis I and Meiosis II.
Meiosis I is a reduction division and Meiosis II is similar to mitosis, each stage consists
of four sub-phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
Before meiosis one cell is in interphase, during S phase of the interphase DNA
replication occur.
Meiosis I
1. Prophase I
Cell enters to the prophase from interphase. Chromosomes begin to condense.
Nucleolus begins to disappear. Next the formation of zipper like structure called the
synaptonemal complex by a specific proteins holds two homolg tightly together. The
pairing and physical connection of homologous chromosomes is called synapsis.
During synapsis part of the DNA molecule of non-sister chromatids paired homologous
chromosomes break, exchange and rejoin at corresponding point. This process is called
crossing over. These points of crossing over become visible as chiasmata after the
synaptonemal complex dissembles and the homologous chromosomes slightly apart
from each other
Nuclear envelop breaks. Centrosomes move towards opposite poles forming spindle
in animal cells.
The kinetochore of each homologue attach to microtubule from one pole or the other.
The homologous pair then moves toward the metaphase plate.
2. Metaphase I
The pair of homologous chromosomes get arranged on the metaphase plate with one
chromosome of each pair faces each pole. Both chromatids of a homologue are attached
to kinetochore microtubules from one pole and those of the other homolog are attached
to kinetochore microtubules from the opposite pole. Homologous chromosome arrange
randomly at metaphase plate. 

3. Anaphase I
Kinetochore microtubules of the spindle get shorten. Homologous pair separates and
one chromosome of each pair moves towards the opposite pole. Sister chromatids of
each chromosome remain attached at the centromere and move as a single unit towards
the same pole.
4. Telophase I
One complete haploid set of chromosomes accumulate at each pole. Nuclear envelope
reforms around each set of chromosomes. Nucleoli reappear. Spindle disintegrates.
Chromosomes decondensed into chromatin. Genetically non identical, haploid, two
daughter nuclei are formed within one cell.
Cytokinesis
Usually occurs simultaneously with telophase I. Genetically non identical, haploid,
two daughter cells are formed. In animal cells, cleavage furrow is formed. In plant
cells a cell plate is formed.
No DNA replication occurs between meiosis I and meiosis II
Meiosis II
1. Prophase II
Centrosomes start producing spindle apparatus (spindle fibers, aster centrosome).
Chromatin fibers condense and produce chromosomes with two sister chromatids.
Nuclear envelope breaks down into fragments. Nucleolus disappears. During the late
prophase II centromere of the chromosomes are moved to the metaphase II plate.
2. Metaphase II
All Chromosomes get attached to the microtubules at their centromere and aligned on
the metaphase plate. Kinetochores of sister chromatids are attached to microtubules
extending from both poles.
Due to the crossing over in meiosis I, the two sister chromatids of each chromosome
are not genetically identical.
Meiosis II usually takes place in the perpendicular direction of Meiosis I. Therefore,
metaphase plate of meiosis II is perpendicular to the metaphase plate of meiosis I.
3. Anaphase II
Due to the breakdown of proteins attaching sister chromatids, they are separated
at centromere. As a result of shortening of microtubules , sister chromatids of each
chromosome move towards opposite poles. 

4. Telophase II
Nuclear envelope and nucleolus reform. Chromosomes decondense into chromatin.
Spindle disassembles. Genetically non identical, haploid, four daughter nuclei are
formed from one parent cell.
Cytokinesis
Cytokinesis occurs as in mitosis. Genetically non identical, haploid, four daughter
cells are formed. These four daughter cells are not even identical to their parent cell.
Centrosomes or centrioles are not available in plant cells. However, spindle is formed
during cell division from accumulated microtubule complex. 

Significance of meiosis
• Maintains the constant number of chromosomes through generations in sexually
reproducing species.
• Producse new genetic variations leading to evolution.
• Genetic variation occurs due to crossing over ,recombination and independent
assortment.
Tumor, cancer and galls
• Cell division is driven by external and internal factors. They may be chemical or
physical factors
• Cancer cells do not respond to normally to the body’s control mechanism
• They divide excessively and invade other tissues. If unchecked they can kill the
organism.

plant growth regulators such as auxins and cytokinins. When this balance is lost
plant cells produce undifferentiated mass of cells.
• Galls are the bumbs and growths that develop on different parts of plants after
being invaded by some very unique organisms.
• Galls have range of causes, including viruses, fungi, bacteria, insects and mites.
• Usually the gall causers in some way attack or penetrate the plants growing
tissues and causes the host to reorganize its cells and to develop an abnormal
growth","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
23,Chemical and cellular basis of life,The energy relationships in metabolic processes,"Sum of all biochemical reactions of living being is known as the metabolism and it
consists of all catabolic and anabolic reactions.
Catabolism is breaking down of complex molecules into simple molecules by
releasing free energy. Therefore it is an exergonic reaction. Anabolism is making
complex molecules from the simple molecules by absorbing free energy. Hence it is
an endergonic reaction.
Biochemical reactions involved in usage of energy released by catabolic reactions in 

living system are called as anabolic reactions. ATP acts as the energy carrier in all
living organism including the simplest bacteria. Therefore the ATP is known as the
universal currency of energy transactions.
Energy can be defined as the capacity to do work. All living organisms require energy
for their living process in many ways. Such processes are;
• Synthesis of substances
• Active transport across plasma membrane
• Transmission of nerve impulses
• Muscle contraction
• Beating of cilia and flagella
• Bioluminescence
• Electrical discharges.
Overall idea of the energy relations of living system on biosphere is composed of
following steps.
• Energy flows into biological systems from the environment through solar radiation. (Primary energy source is the Sun)
• Light energy is captured in the cells having photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll)
by the process of photosynthesis and stored as chemical energy in the organic
compounds such as carbohydrates
• Captured energy in organic food is transformed into chemical energy in ATP by
a process called cellular respiration.
• The energy stored in ATP is utilized in various energy requiring processes 

ATP (Adenosine Tri Phosphate)
ATP is a nucleotide, consisting of,
• Ribose- sugar
• Adenine - nitreogenous base
• A chain of three phosphate groups.
During the hydrolysis of ATP, ADP and Pi are produced. As a result, a very high energy
is released. This is because the reactants (ATP and water) contain more energy in
comparison to products (ADP and Pi). Therefore it yields energy and is an exergonic
reaction.
When ATP is hydrolyzed, the free energy yield of each of the two end phosphate
groups is -30.5kJ/mol. 

Most biological reactions use the energy released during breaking of the terminal
phosphate bond. ATP is mobile. Therefore it can carry energy to anywhere in the cell,
for any energy consuming reaction.
ATP can be produced within living cells within a short period of time, using ADP,
inorganic phosphate (Pi) and energy. Production of ATP within cells is called
phosphorylation. According to the energy source phosphorylation is divided as;
There are three primary types of ATP synthesis mechanisms, each differing in how energy is utilized to produce ATP:
Photophosphorylation refers to the synthesis of ATP using solar energy during the process of photosynthesis. This occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where light energy is captured and converted into chemical energy.
ii. Substrate-level phosphorylation involves the synthesis of ATP by utilizing the energy released from the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones. This process occurs directly during metabolic reactions, such as in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.
iii. Oxidative phosphorylation is the synthesis of ATP using the energy released as a result of the oxidation of molecules. This process takes place in the mitochondria during cellular respiration and involves the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis.




In living cells energy in ATP is transformed into various energy forms which are used
for different functions 

The role of Enzymes in regulating metabolic reactions
An enzyme is a macromolecule, which acts as a biological catalyst. Enzymes are
produced in living cells/
General characteristics of an enzyme:
1. Most of the enzymes are globular proteins.
2. Enzymes are biological catalysts. They lower the activation energy of the
reaction they catalyze (increases the rate of reaction).
3. Most enzymes are heat liable/ sensitive
4. Their presence does not alter the nature or properties of the end products
` of any reaction.
5. Enzymes are highly specific to the substrate (substrate specific)
6. Most enzyme catalyzed reactions are reversible.
7. The rate of enzyme activity is affected by pH, temperature and substrate
concentrations.
8. They are not being used up during the reaction.
9. Enzymes possess active sites where the reaction takes place.
10. Some enzymes need non-proteinous components to catalyse the reaction
which are known as cofactors. 

The mechanisms of enzyme action
The reactant and enzyme acts on is referred to as the substrate. The enzyme binds to its
substrate forming enzyme-substrate complex. While enzyme and substrate form their
complex, catalytic action of the enzyme converts the substrate to the product.
Enzyme + substrate Enzyme-substrate complex Enzyme + Product
The reaction catalyzed by each enzyme is very specific. The specificity of an enzyme
results from its shape. The substrate binds to a specific region of the enzyme. This
region is called the active site. The active site is formed by only a few amino acids.
Other amino acids are needed to maintain the shape of the enzyme molecule. The
shape of the active site is complementary to the shape of the specific substrate of the
enzyme, and hence important in the substrate specificity of the enzyme. The shape
of the active site of an enzyme is not always fully complementary to its substrate. As
enzymes are not rigid structures, the interactions between substrate and active site
may slightly change the shape of the active site, so that the substrate and the active site
become complementary to each other. This is called induced fi t mechanism. The tight
fi t not only brings the substrate molecules and the active site close to each other, but
also ensures the correct orientation of the molecules to help the reaction to proceed
and catalyzes the conversion of substrate to product. Thereafter, the product departs
from the active site of the enzyme. The enzyme is then free to take another substrate
molecule into its active site. 
Cofactors
Non-proteinuos components which are essential for the catalytic activities of certain
enzymes are called cofactors.
These cofactors bind to the enzymes in two ways. Some tightly bind and remain
permanently and others loosely bind temporarily. Loosely bound cofactors are
reversible under certain circumstances.
Organic cofactors are called co-enzymes. e.g. derivatives of vitamins e.g. NAD, FAD
and biotin
Inorganic co-factors – e.g. Zn2+, Fe2+, Cu2+
Factors affecting the rate of enzymatic reactions
1. Temperature
2. pH
3. Substrate concentration
4. Enzyme concentration
5. Inhibitors
Temperature
Increase in temperature increases molecular motion. Therefore the speed of the
moving molecules of both enzymes as well as the substrate will be accelerated. This
will enhance the colliding probability for both enzyme active sites and substrate
molecules. More collision between the enzyme active sites and substrate molecules
generate greater chances for the reaction to occur. This can continue up to a certain 

point, after which there is a rapid decline in enzyme activity. This point is referred to
as optimum temperature. This may vary from organism to organism.
e.g. most of the human enzymes have optimum temperature around the body temperature
(35?C-40?C). Optimum temperature of bacteria in hot springs is about 70?C.
When the temperature increases beyond the optimum temperature, the hydrogen
bonds, ionic and other weak chemical bonds of enzyme active sites may be disrupted.
This will result a change in the shape of the active site of enzyme which will alter
the complementary nature of the active site of enzyme molecules. Therefore, the
complementary binding of enzyme active sites and substrate molecules will be
prevented. The above event is called as denaturation of enzyme molecules.
Therefore the rate of enzyme catalyzed reaction will start to decline when the
temperature increases beyond the optimum temperature and stops completely at certain
temperature, although rate of collision will keep on increasing 

pH
Enzymes function most efficiently within a certain pH range despite maintaining
temperature of the environment constant.
The narrow range of pH in which a particular enzyme catalyzed reaction takes place
is named as the pH range. The pH at which the highest rate of reaction occurs is the
optimum pH of the enzyme. The alteration in pH above or below the optimum pH
may lead to decline in enzyme activity. This is due to the alteration of chemical bonds
involving in formation of enzyme substrate complex. In most enzymes optimum pH
range is 6-8, but there are exceptions. Pepsin works best at pH 2 and optimum pH for
Trypsin is 8. 
Substrate concentration
Increasing substrate concentration increases the probability of collision between
the enzyme and substrate molecules with correct orientation. However the enzyme
molecules will be saturated after a particular concentration and therefore there will not
be any further increase in the rate of reaction.
Enzyme inhibitors
Certain molecules or ions selectively bind permanently or temporarily to the enzyme
molecules and prevent them from forming enzyme-substrate complex. These substances
are called inhibitors.
They are either binding reversibly with weak interactions or binding irreversibly
through covalent bonds.
e.g. Irreversible inhibitors: toxins, poisons
Reversible inhibitors- drugs used against microbes
Competitive inhibitors
Most of these are reversible inhibitors. These chemicals resemble the shape and nature
of the substrate. Therefore they compete with the substrate selectively for the active
site of certain enzymes. As a result of the above, the number of active sites available for
the enzymes may decline and therefore reduces the rate of enzyme catalyzed reactions.
The above situation may be reversed by increasing the substrate concentration.
e.g. Protease inhibitor of drugs against HIV.-change 

Non-competitive inhibitors
These chemicals do not compete with substrate molecules. They interrupt enzymatic
reaction by binding to a part of the enzyme other than the active site. This causes the
enzyme molecule to change its shape in such a way that the active site becomes less
effective for the formation of enzyme substrate complex. 
Regulation mechanism of enzymatic activity in cells
Allosteric regulation of enzymes
In many cases, the molecules that naturally regulate enzyme activity in a cell behave
like reversible non-competitive inhibitors. Regulatory molecules (either activators or
inhibitors) bind to specific regulatory sites elsewhere (other than the active site) of
the molecule via non-covalent interactions and affect the shape and function of the
enzyme. It may result in either inhibition or stimulation of an enzyme activity 

a.) Allosteric activation and inhibition
Most enzymes regulated by allosteric regulation are made from two or more subunits.
Each sub unit composed of a polypeptide chain with its own active site. The entire
complex oscillates between two different shapes one catalyzing active and other
inactive. In this two forms regulatory molecules bind to a regulatory site called
allosteric site, often located where subunits join.
When an activator binds with this regulatory site, stabilizes the shape with functional
active sites. Whereas the inhibitor binds with the regulatory site, it stabilizes the inactive
form of enzyme. Subunits of enzyme arranged in a way through which they transmit
the signals quickly other subunits. Through the interaction of subunits even a single
activator or inhibitor molecule that bind to one regulatory site will affect the active
site of all sub units. e.g. ADP function as allosteric activator bind to the enzyme and
stimulates the production of ATP by catabolism. If the supply of ATP exceed demand
catabolism shows down as ATP bind to the same enzyme as inhibitor.
b.) cooperativity
This is another type of allosteric activation. Binding of one substrate molecule can
stimulate binding or activity at other active site. Thereby increase the catalytic activity.
e.g. hemoglobin (not an enzyme) is made up of four subunits each with an O2
binding site. The binding of a one molecule of O2 to one binding site increases the
affinity for O2 of the remaining binding site.
c.) Feedback inhibition
In feedback inhibition, a metabolic pathway is stopped by the inhibitory binding of
its end product of a process to an enzyme. Thereby limit the production of more end
products than required and thus wasting chemical resources.
Feedback inhibition
Feedback inhibition is an essential process regulates the end products produced in
metabolism.
e.g. ADP function as allosteric activator and stimulates the production of ATP during
the catabolism.
In case ATP supply exceeds demand, catabolism slows down as ATP
molecules function as allosteric inhibitor.
Energy needed for all living processes is obtained directly from ATP. ATP is mainly
produced by a process call ed cellular respiration, in living cells. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
24,Chemical and cellular basis of life,Photosynthesis as an energy fixing mechanism,"Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is a metabolic process by which light energy is trapped and converted
to chemical energy. Chemical energy is stored in chemical bonds of carbohydrates,
fats, oils, and proteins. All life on Earth depends on photosynthesis either directly or
indirectly. Photosynthesis also occurs in algae and certain prokaryotes.
Global importance of photosynthesis;
• All life on earth depends on photosynthesis, directly or indirectly
• Fulfill both carbon and energy requirements of organisms
• Provide O
2 for respiration of aerobic organisms
• Maintain O
2 and CO2 balance in the atmosphere
• Production of fossil fuel
• Maintenance of global temperature
During photosynthesis CO2is reduced by the H of H2O and simple sugars are made
using light energy. In eukaryotic photosynthetic cells, chloroplasts are the sites of
photosynthesis.
Process of photosynthesis consists of two main stages and they are integrated.
• Light-dependent reaction
• Calvin cycle
There are two types of photosynthetic mechanisms (path ways) based on the number
of C atoms of the first stable product of the CO2  fixation.
• C
3 Mechanism – No of C atom of the first stable compound is three
• C
4 Mechanism – No of C atom of the first stable compound is four
Light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis take place in the membrane system
of thylakoids. They are flattened fluid-filled sacs, which form stacks called grana
at intervals. Chlorophylls, carotenoids and electron acceptors are located on this
membrane system of thylakoids.
Stroma is a gel like structure containing soluble enzymes and other chemicals, which
is the site of the Calvin cycle.
Photosynthetic pigments are substances which absorb visible light. In a leaf we see
green colour because chlorophylls absorb violet, blue and red light and therefore, they
transmit and reflect green colour. Different pigments absorb different wavelengths of
light. In chloroplast, there are two types of chloroplast pigments such as chlorophylls
and carotenoids. Chlorophyll a is the key light capturing pigment and they participate
directly in the light reaction of photosynthesis.
According to the action spectrum, chlorophyll a is more effective for blue and red
light. Chlorophyll b and caraotenoids (carotenes and xanthophylls) are effective in
absorption of specific range wavelengths of corresponding to different colours. 

Other important function of some carotenoids is photoprotection. Photoprotection is
absorption and dissipation of excessive light energy, if not that excessive light may
cause damage to the chlorophylls or interact with oxygen and form reactive oxidative
molecules which are dangerous to the cell.
Absorption spectrum
An absorption spectrum is a graph of the relative amounts of light absorbed at different
wavelengths by a pigment. 

Action spectrum
An action spectrum is a graph showing the effectiveness of different wave lengths of
light in stimulating the photosynthesis. 

Excitation of chlorophyll by light
When a molecule of chlorophyll or other photosynthetic pigment absorbs light it
becomes excited. The energy from the light is used to boost electrons to a higher
level and become positively charged. The excited state is unstable and returns to their
original lower energy state. The excited electrons may pass through several electron
carriers until they reach the final electron acceptor. 

Chlorophyll Chlorophyll + + e- (electron)
Therefore chlorophyll is oxidized and electron acceptor is reduced.
Photosystems
Chlorophyll molecules, other organic molecules and proteins are organized into
complexes in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts. They are called photosystems.
A photosystem contains a reaction centre complex and light harvesting complexes.
The reaction centre complex also contains a primary electron acceptor.
There are two types of photosystems found in the thylakoid membrane. They are
Photosystem I (PS I) and photosystem II (PS II).In the PS I the chlorophyll a molecule
is known as P700 since they absorb light at 700nm wave length effectively. In the PS
II the reaction centre contains a chlorophyll a molecule which is known as P680 which
absorbs light having a wavelength of 680 nm.
Light-dependent reaction /Light reaction photosynthesis
Linear electron flow
Light is absorbed by the photosynthetic pigments and synthesize ATP and NADPH
due to the excitation of Photosystem I and Photosystem II which are embedded in
the thylakoid membrane of chloroplast. The key to this energy transformation is a
flow of the electron in one direction through the photosystems and other molecular
components built in the thylakoid. This process is called linear electron flow.
The striking of photons of light on the pigments results in the excitation of electrons
from the photosystem II to the higher energy state.
These electrons will be accepted by the primary electron acceptor of photosystem II.
Splitting of water takes place as a result of an enzyme catalyzed reaction and yields O2
(g), H+ ions and electrons.
Electrons released as a result of hydrolysis may neutralize excited photosystem II
(P680).
Striking of photons of light on the pigments results in the excitation of electrons from
photosystem I (P700) to the higher energy state. Excited electrons will be accepted by
a primary electron acceptor of PSI.
Excited electrons of PS II at primary electron acceptor of PS II will pass through an
electron transport chain to PS I and neutralize the excited PS I. The energy released
due to the passage of electrons from higher energy state to lower energy result in the
synthesis of ATP. This is known as photophosphorylation. Excited electrons of PS I
at primary electron acceptor of PSI will pass through an electron transport chain and 

reduce NADP and yield NADPH. The reduction of NADP is catalyzed by an enzyme
called NADP reductase.
Cyclic electron flow
This occurs in photosystem I but not in Photosystem II. Here some photoexcited
electrons uses alternative cyclic pathway. This produces ATP but not NADPH and
Oxygen are released. 

The Calvin cycle
The Calvin cycle takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast. Energy from ATP and
NADPH produced by the light reaction are used to reduce CO2. The reactions are
catalyzed by enzymes and their sequence was discovered by scientist Calvin. This is
an anabolic reaction. The first stable product of the Calvin cycle is glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate (G3P). For the net synthesis of one molecule of G3P, the cycle must take
place three times.
The Calvin cycle of photosynthesis can be described in three steps;
Carboxylation (Carbon fixation)
Reduction
Regeneration of carbon dioxide acceptor
Carbon fi xation
The CO2 acceptor is a 5 C sugar, Ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). The addition of
CO
2 to a RuBP is called carboxylation. The enzyme involves in this reaction is RuBP
carboxylase oxygenase or Rubisco. 

The first product of RuBP carboxylation is a 6C molecule which is unstable and breaks
down immediately in to two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA). This is the fi rst
stable product of photosynthesis. The enzyme RuBP carboxylase oxygenase (Rubisco)
is present in large amounts in the chloroplast stroma.
Reduction phase
1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate will be reduced to Glyceraldehyde 3- phosphate (G3P)
through step by step. Enzyme catalyzed reactions utilizing NADPH and ATP from
light reaction. G3P will act as a precursor for carbohydrate synthesis (glucose).
Regeneration of RuBP
RuBP is regenerated by undergoing a series of complex reactions. This process uses
energy from ATP generated in light reaction. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
25,Chemical and cellular basis of life,Photorespiration,"As its name suggests, Rubisco is capable of catalyzing two distinct reactions, acting as
both a carboxylase and as an oxygenase.
In the oxygenase reaction of Rubisco uses the same substrate, RUBP, but reacts it with
O
2. The reaction is catalyzed on the same active site as the carboxylation reaction.
Thus CO
2 and O2 are competitive substrates. Therefore, CO2 inhibits the oxygenase and
O
2 Inhibits the carboxylase reaction.
The oxygenase reaction forms just one molecule of 3-PGA plus a two-carbon product,
2-phosphoglycolate which is of no immediate use in the Calvin cycle and in higher
concentrations it is toxic for the plant. It therefore has to be processed in a metabolic
pathway called photorespiration. The photorespiratory pathway involves enzymes in
the chloroplasts, peroxisome and mitochondria. (detail of this pathway is not expected).
Photorespiration is not only energy demanding, but furthermore leads to a net loss
of CO
2 Each time Rubisco reacts with O2 instead of CO2 the plants makes 50% less
3-PGA than it would have done if CO
2 had been used. This potentially eliminates the
net gain in photosynthetic carbon and loose the productivity.
These two factors result in an increase in photorespiration relative to photosynthesis
so that an increasing proportion of carbon is lost as the temperature rises.
The CO
2. required for photosynthesis enters a leaf via stomata. However, stomata
are also the main avenues of transpiration. On a hot, dry day, most plants close their
stomata in order to conserves water. At the same time O
2. released from the light
reactions begins to increase and this leads to further reduction of (CO2.) to (O2) ratio in
the cytosol. These conditions within the leaf favor a wasteful process photorespiration
under high temperature, dryness and high light intensities. 


Therefore plants developed different way to cope with this situation during the
evolution that resulted a most successful solution to concentrate CO
2 around Rubisco
provided by C4 photosynthetic pathway.
The establishment of C4 photosynthetic pathway includes several biochemical and
anatomical modifications that allow plants with this pathway to concentrate CO2 at the
site of Rubisco. Thereby its oxygenase reaction and the following photorespiration are
largely repressed in C4 plants.
In most C4 plants the CO2 concentration mechanism is achieved by a division of labor
between two distinct specialized leaf cell types, the mesophyll and the bundle sheath
cells. Compared to C3 plants the bundle sheath cells of C4 plants have expanded
physiological functions. This is reflected by the enlargement and higher organelle
content of these cells in C4 species. For the efficient function of the C4 pathway a
close contact between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells are tightly interconnected to
each other by high numbers of plasmodesmata. The bundle sheath cells enclose the
vascular bundles and are themselves surrounded by the mesophyll cells and this type
of leaf anatomy was termed Kranz anatomy.
Since Rubisco can operate under high CO2 concentrations in the bundle sheath cells, it
works more efficiently than in C3 plants. Because of the CO2 concentration mechanism
they can acquire enough CO2 even when keeping their stomata more closed and
minimize the water loss by transpiration.
C4 pathway of photosynthesis
In the mesophyll cells of C4 plants CO2 is converted to bicarbonate by carbonic
anhydrase and initially fixed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase using PEP as CO2
acceptor. The resulting oxaloacetate (OAA) is composed of four carbon atoms, which
is the basis for the name of this metabolic pathway. Oxaloacetate is rapidly converted
to the more stable C4 acids malate or aspartate that diffuse to the bundle sheath cells.
Here, CO2 is released by decarboxylating enzymes and the released CO2 is refixed by
Rubisco, which exclusively operates in the bundle sheath cells in C4 plants.
Chloroplasts found in mesophyll cells are different in anatomy in comparison to
chloroplasts of bundle sheath cells.
Since chloroplasts of mesophyll cells carryout only light reaction, they are rich in
grana. The grana of mesophyll chloroplasts are large and highly differentiated for light
reaction. Bundle sheath chloroplasts possess a very few, less differentiated grana or
grana are absent. Moreover, that PSII in the bundle sheath cells are depleted in order
to lower oxygen production in these cells. 

This PEP carboxylase enzyme is much more efficient than the enzyme of RUBP
carboxylase for two reasons.
1. It reacts with bicarbonate (HCO-3) rather than with CO2’ The advantage
of this is that there is a 50-fold higher concentration of HCO3- than CO2
in solution in the cytosol.
2. It has no affinity for O2 

Significance of the C4 pathway
• Helps plants to improve the efficiency of CO2 fixation at lower CO2concentrations
by preventing the gateways for photorespiration by spatially separating Rubisco.
• In hot-dry climate, it is essential for the stomata to close to prevent water loss
through transpiration. This reduces CO2 intake of particular plants. Therefore,
plants in tropical zones or hot climate may suffer from CO2 deficiency. At lower
CO2  concentrations, C4 mechanism increases the efficiency of photosynthesis
by concentrating CO2 in the bundle sheath cells. 

C4 plants exhibit better water-use efficiency than C3 plants because of the CO2
concentration mechanism they can acquire enough CO2 even when keeping their
stomata more closed. Thus water loss by transpiration is reduced.
Since Rubisco can operate under high CO2 concentrations in the bundle sheath cells,
it woks more efficiently than in C3 plants, consequently C4 plants need less of this
enzyme, this leads to a better nitrogen-use efficiency of C4 compared to C3 plants. 

Comparisons of C3 and C4 plants 

C3 plants, such as wheat, rice, and barley, have an optimum temperature for photosynthesis between 15-25°C. In these plants, CO? fixation occurs only once, with the CO? acceptor being a 5-carbon compound called RuBP. The enzyme responsible for fixing CO? is Rubisco, which produces a 3-carbon compound, 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA), as the first product. The leaf anatomy in C3 plants involves mesophyll cells where photosynthesis occurs, with non-green bundle sheath cells. C3 plants typically have lower productivity.
C4 plants, including maize, sugarcane, and grasses, thrive in higher temperatures, with photosynthesis being 50% more efficient at 35°C. CO? fixation occurs twice, first in the mesophyll cells and then in the bundle sheath cells. The initial CO? acceptor is a 3-carbon compound, PEP, in the mesophyll cells, and RuBP in the bundle sheath cells. PEP carboxylase, an efficient enzyme, fixes CO? in the mesophyll, while Rubisco operates efficiently under high CO? concentrations in the bundle sheath cells. The first product of CO? fixation in C4 plants is a 4-carbon acid, oxaloacetate (OAA). C4 plants have Kranz anatomy, where photosynthesis occurs in both mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. They are generally more productive, yielding higher outputs than C3 plants.
Factors affecting photosynthesis
The rate of photosynthesis is an important factor in crop production. Rate is affected
by various factors.
e.g. light intensity, CO2 concentration, temperature, water, pollutants and
inhibitors
The photosynthesis involves a series of reactions. Therefore various factors are
involved in it.
Blackman who is the scientist first proposed the idea of principal of limiting factors.
When a chemical process is affected by more than one factor, its rate is limited by the
factor which is nearest its minimum value.
e.g. Light intensity 

Light Intensity
The rate of photosynthesis increases linearly with increasing light intensity. Gradually
the rate of increase falls off as the other factors become limiting. Very high light
intensities chlorophyll may bleach and slow down photosynthesis. However, plants
exposed to such conditions are usually protected by devices such as thick cuticles,
hairy leaves. 

Under normal conditions, CO2 is the major limiting factor in photosynthesis. Increase
in photosynthetic rate is achieved by increasing CO2 concentration. For example some
greenhouse crops such as tomatoes are grown in CO2 enriched atmosphere. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
26,Chemical and cellular basis of life,Cellular respiration as a process of obtaining energy,"Cellular respiration is the process by which chemical energy in organic molecules such
as carbohydrates is released by stepwise oxidative process, catalyzed by enzymes and
made available in living cells in the form of ATP. Cellular respiration is divided as
a) aerobic respiration
b) anaerobic respiration
Aerobic respiration:-
The process of synthesize ATP from the respiratory substrates such as glucose in the
presence of molecular oxygen (O2) known as aerobic respiration. Glucose is found to
be the major respiratory substrate in living cells.
The aerobic respiration of glucose molecules can be represented by the following
balanced chemical equation. 

C
6H12O6 + 6O2(g) ---->6CO2(g) + 6H2O + Energy (ATP+ heat)
This process consist three main steps. They are;
a) Glycolysis
b) Pyruvate oxidation and citric acid cycle (Kreb’s cycle)
c) oxidative phosphorylation (Electron transport chain) 

Glycolysis
It takes place in the cytosol of the cell, because all enzymes that catalyze reactions of
the glycolysis are found in the cytosol of the cell. This process does not depend on O2.
During the above process a six carbon (6C) glucose molecule is broken down step by
step into two three-carbon (3C) pyruvate molecules.
Two ATP molecules are used up to initiate the process.
Four hydrogen molecules and electrons released from glucose breakdown reduce
two NAD+ and produce two NADH. At the end of glycolysis there will be four ATP
molecules produced. Since two ATP molecules were used up for the initiative step, the
net yield will be two ATP molecules.
Only when O2 is present, the pyruvate molecules will enter the mitochondria and
further steps will take place.
Oxidation of Pyruvate/ Link reaction
These two pyruvate molecules enter mitochondrion by active transport through the
membrane. In the matrix of mitochondria, Pyruvate is converted to acetyl group by
releasing two CO2 molecules. Then this acetyl group combines with co-enzyme A to 

produce Acetyl co-A. In this reaction two NAD+ is converted to two NADH molecules.
Therefore this step can be represented as follows.
2C
3H4O3 + 2CoA + 2NAD+ 2 ---->Acetyl Co-A + 2CO2+ 2 NADH
Oxidation of pyruvate is a linking reaction of glycolysis and citric acid cycle.
Acetyl Co-A will feed its acetyl group for citric acid cycle. 

Citric acid cycle
This takes place in the matrix of mitochondria using specific enzymes. As the fi rst
product of this cyclic pathway is citric acid, it is known as citric acid cycle. The pathway
was discovered by a German-British scientist Hans Krebs. Hence, it is named as Kreb’s
cycle. Citric acid contains three carboxylic acid groups. This cycle is also known as
Tricarboxylic Acid cycle or TCA cycle. In the citric acid cycle 4 C compound oxalo
acetate combines with 2 C compound acetyl Co -A to form 6 C compound, citric acid.
Then citric acid undergoes a series of reactions to regenerate oxaloacetate by releasing
two CO
2 molecules by decarboxylation reaction. One ATP molecule is produced by
substrate level phosphorylation. One FADH2 and three NADH will be generated as a
result of oxidation reactions. These are the products of a single acetyl group led into
citric acid cycle and hence these numbers should double when the yield for a glucose
molecule is considered. 

Electron transport chain
This step is taken place across the inner membrane (cristae) of mitochondria. The
folding of cristae increases surface area for oxidative phosphorylation. NADH and
FADH
2 products in the early stages of aerobic respiration are oxidized by transferring
electrons, through the electron transport chain and finally to molecular oxygen (O2).
The electron transport chain is located in the inner membrane of mitochondrion and
composed of series of protein and non-protein molecules involving in the movement
of electrons and protons across cristae. Therefore, the Molecular oxygen(O2)is the
final electron acceptor in aerobic respiration. In the electron transport chain, ATP is
synthesized by oxidative phosphorylation.
In this electron transport chain, energy is released progressively from NADH and
FADH
2 and that energy is used to synthesize ATP. When one molecule of NADH is
oxidized in the electron transport chain, 2.5 molecules of ATP in average are generated
due to oxidative phosphorylation. When one molecule of FADH2 is oxidized 1.5
molecules of ATP in average are produced due to oxidative phosphorylation. Total
number of ATP that is produced in this step is 28.
This is true in the active cells such as liver cells and cardiac muscle cells but not in
other cells where two ATP produced in glycolysis is used to transport 2NADH from
cytosol to mitochondrial matrix. In those cells total number of ATP produced by one
molecule of glucose is (32-2) = 30 ATP.
Total number of ATP molecules produced from one molecule of glucose, during
aerobic respiration.

Anaerobic respiration
Anaerobic respiration is breaking down of glucose in the absence of molecular oxygen
which is regulated by enzymes of the cells occurring in cytosol. In the absence of
molecular oxygen pyruvate molecules cannot be broken down further. ATP generated
is utilized to fulfill energy requirements. However, NADH produced during glycolysis
cannot be utilized. Therefore, since NAD+ is limited it is essential for the cell to
recycle NADH to enhance the availability of NAD+ other than anaerobic respiration 

fermentation is a method of production of ATP in the absence of O2 . There are many
types of fermentation, differing from end products formed by pyruvate. The two
common types are;
1. Ethyl alcohol fermentation
2. Lactic acid fermentation
Ethyl alcohol fermentation
• Like in aerobic respiration, the first step of this is also Glycolysis.
• Therefore one molecule of glucose is converted to 2 molecules of pyruvate
giving 2 molecules of ATP and two molecules of NADH
• Then this pyruvate involve in two steps. In the 1st step pyruvate is converted in
to Acetyldehyde, releasing a molecule of CO2.
• In the second step acetyldehyde is reduced to ethanol using NADH that is
produced in Glycolysis.
• Therefore final hydrogen acceptor in ethyl alcohol fermentation is acetylaldehyde
(organic compound)
• Many bacteria carry out ethyl alcohol fermentation. The most common organism
which carries out ethyl alcohol fermentation is yeast.
Lactic acid fermentation
• As in ethyl alcohol fermentation, Glycolysis takes place as the first step of lactic
acid fermentation.
• Therefore one molecule of glucose produces two molecules of pyruvate, two
molecules of ATP and two molecules of NADH.
• Then pyruvate is reduced directly by NADH for lactic acid as an end product
with no release of CO
2. Therefore final H acceptor is also organic compounds.
• Certain fungi and bacteria carryout lactic acid fermentation but the most common
organisms are lactic acid bacteria involved in formation of yoghurt and curd.
Respiratory quotient
It is the ratio of CO
2 evolved and the volume of O2 consumed in a given time for the
respiratory substrate.
RQ= V CO2/ VO2
RQ of respiration of carbohydrates, fats and proteins are 1.0, 0.7 and 0.8 respectively. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
27,Evolution and Diversity of Organisms,"The theories of origin of life and natural selection to analyze the
process of evolution of life","Origin of life on earth
Condition of earth before life
Earth and the other planets of the solar system were formed about 4.6 billion years ago. At the beginning of the solar system, planet Earth was being bombarded by
chunks of rocks and ice.
The first atmosphere was probably thick with water vapour, along with various
compounds released by volcanic eruptions, including nitrogen and its oxides, carbon
dioxide, methane, ammonia, hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide. The neutral atmosphere
then turned to be a reducing one. The first atmosphere had little oxygen. Later earth was
cooled down and the water vapour condensed into the ocean. Some of the hydrogen
quickly escaped into the space. Volcanic eruptions, lightening, extreme UV radiation,
hydro thermal vents and alkaline vents along with the Earth’s reducing atmosphere
favored the synthesis of organic molecules essential for the origin of life. These simple
organic molecules then polymerized to form macromolecules such as proteins and
nucleic acids. Further, the formation of self-replicating organic molecules made life
possible on earth.
Evolution of Biological Diversity
1. Biochemical evolution
Direct evidence for life on early earth comes from fossils of micro-organisms that
are about 3.5 billion years old. Observations and experiments in chemistry, geology
and physics have provided evidence, for the appearance of the first living cells. The
theory of the biochemical evolution arouse from the hypothesis based on chemical and
physical processes on early earth. The emerging force of natural selection could have
produced the first cells through a sequence of four main stages.
1. Atmospheric conditions of early earth facilitated the abiotic synthesis of
small organic molecules such as amino acids and nitrogenous bases from
inorganic molecules 

2. Polymerization of the above small organic molecules leads to the
formation of organic macromolecules.
a. Amino acids proteins
b. N-base + sugar+ phosphate Nucleic acids
3. Organic macromolecules were packed into membranes, to produce
protocells
4. Nucleic acids gained self replicating capability, which made inheritance
possible for the cells.
2. Origin of protocell
Haldane suggested that the early oceans were a solution of organic molecules
“primitive soup” in which life arose. Recent studies related to the volcanic-atmosphere
and alkaline vents show the abiotic synthesis of organic molecules. Another source
of organic molecules may have been meteorites. RNA accumulated into lipid bound
vesicles and formed “protocells” which exhibited enzyme catalyzed activities and were
able to grow, replicate and evolve. The early genes and enzymes would have been
RNA which enabled replication of RNA. Other molecules that were in the primitive
soup were also collected in the protocell. Growth occurred by addition of lipids to the
membrane by collision of micelles. When the protocell becomes too large, it divided
to form two protocells with RNA included.
3. Origin of photosynthetic organisms
Fossils of the first photosynthetic organism, today’s cyanobacteria, originated before
2.7 billion years ago. As a result of photosynthesis iron (Fe 2+) ion were oxidized.
Once all of the dissolved iron has precipitated, additional O2 dissolved in the water
until the water bodies became saturated with O
2. The increase of photosynthetic
bacteria contributed to the increment of the amount of atmospheric oxygen which had
accelerated the origin of chloroplast.
4. The origin of first eukaryote
The fossils of the first eukaryotic organisms were estimated as from about 1.8 billion
years ago. These eukaryotic single cellular organisms later evolved in to multicellular
organisms. The appearance of structurally complex eukaryotic cells sparked the
evolution of greater morphological diversity than was possible for the simple
prokaryotic cells. After the first eukaryotes appeared, a great range of unicellular forms
evolved. It gave rise to diversity of some single-celled eukaryotes which evolved in to
multicellular forms, such as the varieties of algae, plants, fungi and animals. Fossils
of the oldest known protists similar to small red algae were dated as 1.2 billion years
ago. 

5. Diversifi cation of Eukaryotes
Many present day animal phyla appeared in the early Cambrian period. Several animal
groups which include, porifera, sponges, cnidarians (Sea anemones and their relatives)
and molluscs appeared in the late Proterozoic. According to the DNA analysis, sponges
evolved 700 million years ago. Ancestors of arthropods, chordates and other animal
phyla originated 670 million years ago. The first food chains on earth appeared when
animals started to depend on algae or plants as consumers and with the arrival of many
groups of animals, functioning food webs began to appear. Colonization of land by
fungi, plants and animals began after about 500 million years ago. Plants that colonized
land possess vascular systems to transport water and minerals and water proof coating
of wax to prevent the water loss. With the emergence of large trees, differentiation as
roots, stems and leaves began and diversifi ed since 40 million years ago. Plants and
fungi colonized the land together by interacting with each other. Arthropods (insects
and spiders) were the first group of animals to colonize the land. The earliest tetrapods
formed about 365 million years ago which were evolved from lobed-finned fi sh. The
divergence of human lineage from other primates was initiated 6-7 million years ago.
The origin of the human species took place 195,000 years ago.

28,Evolution and Diversity of Organisms,Theories of evolution,"Evolution can be defined as a change in the genetic composition of a population from
generation to generation (descent with modification) over a long period of time. This
may take millions of years.
Theories of evolution are
• Theory of Lamarck.
• Darwin - Wallace theory (Theory of Natural selection)
• Neo Darwinism
Theory of Lamarck
Lamarck published his hypothesis in 1809. He explained his hypothesis using two
principles.
1. Use and disuse
2. Inheritance of acquired characteristics 

1. Use and disuse - The parts of the body that are used extensively become
larger and stronger. If not used, they deteriorate.
e.g.- Giraffe stretching its neck to reach leaves on higher branches.
2. Inheritance of acquired characteristics – Organism acquired adaptation during
their life time according to the needs of enviro off spring is better adapted to
live in that environment e.g. long muscular neck of the giraffe had evolved
over many generations as giraffes stretch their necks even higher
Darwin - Wallace theory (Theory of natural selection)
Darwin observed two phenomena from the environment. His observations were;
The populations of a species vary in characteristics among their inheritance traits.
Each species produces more offspring than their environment could accommodate.
The above observations were interpreted by Charles Darwin as,
Certain traits of a population which are capable of exhibiting qualities for better
surviveal and their reproduction can produce more offspring.
Variation in abilities for survival and production among a population may enhance
the abundance of favorable characteristics in that population.
Some favorable characteristics for survival and reproduction are;
• Escaping from predators - defense
• Tolerating physical conditions – stress conditions
• Obtaining food
• Resistance against disease
• Fertilizing probability
• Number of offspring produced
Process of natural selection
• Over production
• Variation
• Competition and survival of the fi ttest
• Natural selection of favourable traits
Neo-Darwinism
Neo-Darwinism generally denotes the integration of Charles Darwin’s theory of natural
selection, Mendelian genetics as the basis for biological inheritance and knowledge of
population genetics. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
29,Evolution and Diversity of Organisms,Hierarchy of taxa on scientific basis,"Methods of artificial and natural classification
Arrangement of organisms into groups on the basis of the common characteristics is
called classification. Taxonomy is the scientific study on classification, identification,
nomenclature and description. This includes placing groups of organisms in a
hierarchical sequence.
Two methods of classification
(1) Artificial classification - grouping is based on a few pre selected
unifying characters.
• The characters are selected first according to convenience and organisms are
grouped based on the selected criteria
• Evolutionary relationships are ignored
• Only system used before 18th century
• Easy to use, easy to expand by adding more groups
e.g. Plants can be classified as cereals, ornamental plants, medicinal plants,
poisonous plants etc. Animals can be classified as two legged, four
legged, six legged, eight legged etc.
(2) Natural classification - grouping based on true relationships.
• Represents evolutionary relationships based on phylogeny- evolutionary history
of a species or groups of species
• Systems developed after then study of evolution.
• Based on many characteristics.
Characteristics used can be morphological, anatomical, cytological or molecular
biological such as DNA and RNA base sequences
e.g. Plants can be classified into phyla; Bryophyta, Lycophyta, Pterophyta,
Cycadophyta, Coniferophyta and Anthophyta etc. Animals can be
classifi ed into Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes etc.
History of classification
The early classification systems were all artificial systems and were mostly based on
human uses.
Aristotle was the first to classify organisms scientifically. He divided organisms into
plants and animals. Animals were further classified according to criteria such as mode
of locomotion, reproduction and presence or absence of red blood cells. Aristotle’s
pupil Theophrastus classified plants according to habit. e.g. trees, shrubs and herbs,
and according to lifespan e.g. annuals, biennials and perennials. 

Up to the time of Linnaeus scientists have used many different methods for naming
of organisms. Carolus Linnaeus(1753), Swedish botanist, introduced binomial
nomenclature and also classified about 6,000 plants into a hierarchical order of taxa,
classification level such as; Species, genus, order, and class. His classification of
flowering plants was based on the number of stamens and styles of flower. He identified
two kingdoms of organisms; plants and animals.
With the discovery of the microorganisms the scientists understood that there were
organisms which could not be assigned into either plants or animals. To get over
this difficulty Ernest Haeckel (1866) introduced a third kingdom: Protista. He also
introduced the taxon Phylum and classified many organisms.
With the discovery of the electron microscope biologists identified prokaryotic and
eukaryotic cellular organization. Robert H Whittaker (1969) introduced the five
kingdom system of biological classification; Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae and
Animalia. His classification was based on the nature of cellular organization, unicellular
or multicellular and mode of nutrition.
With the acceptance of Darwin’s theory of the evolution and unitary origin of life,
taxonomists began to use natural systems with interpreting evolutionary relationships.
With the recent advancement of molecular biology and the use of molecular methods
in studying evolutionary relationships it became apparent that in the very early
evolution some prokaryotes differ as much from each other as do from eukaryotes.
Such difficulties have lead biologists to adopt three Domain system of classification.
The three domains are Bacteria, Archea and Eukarya, which are taxonomic ranks
higher than the Kingdom. Carl Woese (1977) introduced this three domain system.,
In this tree of life the first major split in the history of life occurred when bacteria
diverged from others. Eukarya and Archea are mostly related to each other than
bacteria. 

Present system of classification and its basis
The present system of classification is mainly based on the rapid advance of molecular
biology and the new information on the evolutionary relationships of organisms.
• the sequence of bases of DNA of important genes
• the sequences of bases of DNA of mitochondria and chloroplasts
• the base sequence of ribosomal RNA
• the sequence of amino acids in common proteins
• the molecular structure of cellular components
are used as important taxonomic criteria in modern systematics. 

However, the kingdom Protista is not a natural group. It is an artificial group including
organisms which have different evolutionary origins.
Viruses do not have cellular organization, and therefore do not belong to any of the
kingdoms. They are also an artificial group considered separately.

Hierarchy of Taxa from Domains to Species
The taxonomic unit at any level/ rank of the hierarchy is called a taxon (plural-taxa).
Each taxon has a rank and a name.
e.g. Panthera is a taxon at the Genus level/ rank
Mammalia is a taxon at the Class level/ rank
Under the hierarchical system there are levels/ ranks of taxa. Each Domain is divided
into kingdoms. A Kingdom is divided into phyla (singular phylum), phylum into
classes .etc. Many of these categories may also be subdivided.
e.g. Super class, Sub-family, Subspecies, etc. 

From domain to species, the number of shared characteristics among the members
in the taxa increases. From species to domain, the number of individuals in the taxon
increases. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
30,Evolution and Diversity of Organisms,Biological definition of a species,"Species is a group of organisms who shares similar characteristics and has the ability
to interbreed and produce viable and fertile offspring.
Other definitions of species
• Morphological species concept- use of morphological criteria to distinguish
species such as body shape and other structural features 

• Ecological species concept–defines species in terms of its ecological niche and
the sum of how members of the species interact with the non living and the living
components of their environment
• Phylogenetic species concept – defines the species as the smallest group of
individuals that share a common ancestor.
Binomial nomenclature
In classification, use of common names for organisms, causes confusion. More over
some common names do not actually reflect the kind of organism they signify.
e.g. Jelly fish (a Cnidarian)
Cray fish (a Crustacian)
Silver fish (an insect)
Star fish (an Echinoderm)
Further, a given organism has different names in different languages. Carolous
Linnaeus (1707-1778) proposed a binomial system of nomenclature of species, which
was accepted worldwide to avoid ambiguity.
According to the binomial nomenclature the name of an organism has two parts:
First is the generic name, to which the species belongs and the second is a specific
epithet, the unique for each species within the genus. Generic name is usually a noun
and the specific epithet an adjective describing a particular feature.
e.g. Homo sapiens- Homo means man, sapiens means intelligent
Related species have the same generic name with different specific epithets.
e.g. Dipterocarpus zeylanicus and Dipterocarpus grandiflorus
Dipterocarpus zeylanicus means fruit with two wings, and endemic to Sri Lanka.
Dipterocarpus grandiflorus means fruit with two wings and having large flowers.
International codes of Binominal nomenclature
Biologists have adopted sets of rules or Codes of nomenclature. These codes are slightly
different for plants, animals, bacteria and viruses. Some of the important rules for
naming plants, fungi, bacteria and animals are as follows.
• Two species of organisms cannot have the same name.
• Each species has a generic name and a specific epithet, both together forming the
species name or scientific name.
• The Name should be made up of Latinized words written in the Roman script.
• It should be underlined when hand written and italicized when printed.
• The first letter of the generic name must be capitalized the and specific epithet
must be in simple letters. 

In scientific writing, the name of the author who gave the name is indicated by a capital
letter, an abbreviation or full word at the end of the name, which is not Latinized.
e.g. Cocos nucifera L., (L for Linnaeus).
A third word can be used to represent a subspecies or a variety, example Panthera
parduskotiya (Sri Lankan leopard).
• Use of keys
• Used to group organisms and identify them
• Keys do not show the evolutionary relationships
• The Commonly used key is the dichotomous key
• Some examples are given below 

Domains
There are three domains. They are;
a) Domain – Bacteria- consists of one kingdom. Kingdom - Bacteria
b) Domain –Archaea-consists of one kingdom. Kingdom - Archaebacteria
c) Domain –Eukarya-consists of four kingdoms. 

Kingdom - Protista
Kingdom - Fungi

classified as Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria
• Most of their cell walls are surrounded by a sticky layer of polysaccharides or
proteins called capsule
• Most of them have flagella for motility. Bacterial flagellum differs from
eukaryotic flagellum as they are not covered by a plasma membrane and absence
of 9+2 structure of microtubules.
• Possess diverse nutritional modes-Autotrophs, heterotrophs
• Posses diverse metabolic modes- obligate aerobes, obligate anaerobes, facultative
anaerobes, etc.
• Some are capable of performing nitrogen fixation- e.g. Rhizobium sp., some
cyanobacteria

• Diverse in nutrition
• Mostly aerobes
• Most of them exhibit sexual reproduction (some protists are only known
to reproduce asexually) 

A comparison of the three domains of life 

Bacteria are prokaryotic organisms with cell walls composed of peptidoglycan. Their membrane lipids contain unbranched hydrocarbons. Bacteria do not have histones associated with DNA, and their chromosomes are circular. Introns are rare in bacterial genes. Bacterial RNA polymerase exists in one form, and protein synthesis begins with the amino acid formylmethionine. Their growth is inhibited by antibiotics like streptomycin and chloramphenicol, and they do not thrive at temperatures above 100°C. Bacteria inhabit diverse environments, and examples include Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, and cyanobacteria like Nostoc and Anabaena.
Archaea are also prokaryotic but lack peptidoglycan in their cell walls, which are instead made of proteins and polysaccharides. Some of their membrane lipids contain branched hydrocarbons. Archaea have histones associated with DNA in some species, and their chromosomes are circular. Introns are present in some archaeal genes. They possess several kinds of RNA polymerase, and methionine is the initiator amino acid for protein synthesis. Unlike bacteria, Archaea do not have their growth inhibited by antibiotics like streptomycin and chloramphenicol, and some species can grow at temperatures above 100°C. Archaea often live in extreme environments like volcanic pits and hot springs. Examples include Methanococcus and Thermococcus.
Eukarya are eukaryotic organisms, meaning their cells have a true nucleus and organelles. Their cell walls, if present, are composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and chitin. Like bacteria, their membrane lipids contain unbranched hydrocarbons. Histones are associated with DNA, and their chromosomes are linear rather than circular. Introns are present in many eukaryotic genes. Eukaryotes have several kinds of RNA polymerase, and protein synthesis begins with methionine. Growth in eukaryotes is not inhibited by antibiotics like streptomycin and chloramphenicol, and they do not grow at temperatures above 100°C. Eukaryotes inhabit diverse environments, with examples including protists, fungi, plants, and animals.","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"

32,Evolution and Diversity of Organisms,The diversity of organisms within the kingdom Plantae,"Kingdom Plantae
Evolutionary relationships among major groups of plants 

It is believed that members of the kingdom Plantae were evolved from a group of
chlorophytes/ green algae. Most of them are terrestrial organisms. Chlorophyte algae
lack key traits of land plants, walled spores produced in sporangia, multicellular
gametangia, dependent embryo and apical meristem. They evolved in the terrestrial
environment.
Plant groups can be distinguished based on the presence or absence of an extensive
system of vascular tissue. Based on that there are two major groups of plants the can
be seen; they are Vascular plants and Non-vascular plants. 

Diversification of Kingdom Plantae
• Non-vascular plants
• Phylum Bryophyta - Mosses- Pogonatum
• Phylum Hepatophyta- Marchantia
• Phylum- Anthocerophyta- Anthoceros
• Vascular seedless plants
• Phylum – Lycophyta- Selaginella
• Phylum – Pterophyta- Nephrolepis
• Vascular seed plants

• Gymnosperms- Phylum – Cycadophyta (Cycas sp.),
Phylum- Coniferophyta (Pinus ), Phylum – Gnetophyta (Gnetum )
• Angiosperms- Phylum – Anthophyta (all flowering plants)
n-vascular plants
One way to distinguish a group of plants is to see whether or not they have an
extensive system of vascular tissue that transport water and nutrients throughout the
lant body. Most present day plants do have a complex vascular tissue system and
therefore, are called vascular plants. Plants that do not have an extensive transport
system are described as non vascular plants. Non vascular plants are informally named
s Bryophytes.
e.g. Marchantia, Pogonatum, Antheroceros
Bryophytes share some derived traits with vascular plants, but lack in many innovations
f vascular plants such as presence of true stems, roots and leaves.
Diversity of Bryophytes
hylum- Hepatophyta e.g. Marchantia (liverworts).
hylum Anthocerophyta e.g. Anthoceros (hornworts)
hylum Bryophyta e.g. Pogonatum (mosses)
racteristic features of phylum Bryophyta
.g. Pogonatum
• Especially common in moist terrestrial places.
• Haploid gametophyte is dominant stage of the life cycle, photosynthetic and
independent.
• Gametophytes are differentiated into ‘leaves’, ‘stems’ and rhizoids. They have
no vascular tissues. Archegonia and antheridia are typically carries on separate
female and male gametophyte. Therefore gametophyte is dioecious.
• Male plant produces flagellated sperm which can swim through a film of water
for fertilization.
• Sporophytes are usually green and photosynthetic when young. However, they
are not independent. They attach to their parental gametophytes and absorb
nutrients and water from the female gametophyte.
• Sporophytes have specialized pores called stomata which are also found in all
vascular plants.
• They are homosporous.
Vascular plants cover about 93% of the existing plant species. They can be further
divided into two groups. 

1. Seedless vascular plants
2. Seed plants
Seedless vascular plants
Seedless vascular plants lack seeds and disperse by
means of spores. They are categorized into two groups.
1. Lycophytes
2. Pterophytes
Even though, both pterophytes and lycophytes are seedless plants, pterophytes share a
more recent common ancestor with seed plants.
Fossils and living seedless vascular plants provide evidence for plant evolution during
Devonian and Carboniferous periods. The ancestors of vascular plants already have
had some derived traits of modern vascular plants; however, they lack roots and some
other adaptations.
Fossils suggest that, the ancestors of vascular plants had gametophyte and sporophytes
that were about equal in size. However among the living vascular plants sporophyte
generation is large and more complex. For example in ferns, leafy plants are the
sporophytes
Significant features of seedless vascular plants;
1. Transportation through Xylem and Phloem
Vascular plants have two types of vascular tissues; Xylem and Phloem
Xylem consists of tracheids, fibers and parenchyma cells- conducts water and minerals.
Cell walls of tracheids and fibers are strengthened by the polymer lignin. These tissues
permit plants to grow tall. This may facilitate them to obtain a high amount of light
for photosynthesis and ease the spore dispersal.
Phloem- this tissue has cells arranged in tubes. They distribute sugars, amino acids
and other organic products among different parts of the plant.
2. Evolution of roots
Roots are organs that absorb water and nutrients from the soil. They anchor the plants
and allow the shoot system to grow taller. They are to replace the rhizoids seen in
bryophytes. Root tissues of living plants resemble stem tissues of the early vascular
plants preserved in fossils.
3. Evolution of leaves- There are two types of leaves. They are microphylls and
megaphylls. Microphylls are single veined and smaller in size while megaphylls are
large, flattened with branched veins.
Leaves with branched vascular tissues increase the surface area for efficient
photosynthesis (megaphylls) 

Sporophylls and spore variations
Modified leaves that bear sporangia are known as sporophylls. Most seedless vascular
plant species produce one type of sporangium and one type of spores. Therefore, they
are known as homosporous.
Some plant species produce two types of sporangia and produce two kinds of spores
called mega spores and microspores. This condition is known as heterosporous.
Mega spores develop into female gametophyte while microspores develop into male
gametophyte.
Phylum Lycophyta
• Lycophytes are terrestrial and some are epiphytes.
• The dominant plant is sporophyte.
• They produce upright stems and ground hugging stems.
• In upright stems small leaves can be found.
• Ground hugging stems produce dichotomously branching roots.
• They have strobili. In many club mosses and spike mosses sporophylls are
clustered into club shaped cones/ strobili.
• They are homosporous or heterosporous.
Spike mosses are usually relatively smaller and often grow horizontally.
• All Club mosses are homosporous;
e.g. Lycopodium sp.
• All Spike mosses are heterosporous.
e.g. Selaginella
In some species the tiny gametophyte live above
the ground and are photosynthetic. Others live
below the ground and are nourished by symbiotic
fungi.
Phylum Pterophyta
• Most sporophytes have rhizome (an underground stem)
• At the tip of the rhizome they produce leaves, called fronds
• Many fronds are highly dissected and feathery.
• All species are homosporous which develop into a bisexual gametophyte.
• Sporophytes are dominant
e.g. Nephrolepis 

Seed plants
Vascular plants consist of seeds and are a called
“seed plants”. They represent the vast majority of
living plant species.
Seed plants can be divided into two groups, based
on the absence or presence of enclosed chambers in
which seeds mature.
1. Gymnosperms
2. Angiosperms
Gymnosperms are “naked seed” plants as their seeds are not enclosed in chambers.
Angiosperms are “seed plant” group accommodating all flowering plants. Angiosperm
seeds develop inside chambers called ovaries; which originate within flowers and
mature into fruits.
Significant features of seed plants
1. Production of seed
A seed consists of an embryo and endosperm. Endosperms supply food to the embryo.
This endosperm is surrounded by a protective coat which is known as seed coat. When
seeds are mature they can be dispersed through various dispersal methods.
Seeds are key adaptations that help seed plants to become the dominant producers on
land and to exhibit the vast plant diversity of today.
2. Reduced gametophyte
The evolutionary trend of gametophyte reduction continued further in the vascular
plants and led to seed plants. The gametophyte of seed vascular plants is not visible to
the naked eye. They are mostly microscopic.
Tiny gametophytes develop from spores and are retained within the sporangia of
sporophyte. This arrangement protects the gametophyte from environmental stresses.
The moist reproductive tissues of the sporophyte shield the gametophyte from UV
radiation and protect them from drying out. This relationship also enables the dependent
gametophyte to obtain nutrients from the sporophyte.
3. Heterospory
Seed plants are heterosporous (produce both megaspores and microspores). Each
megasporangium has a single functional megaspore and each microsporangium
contains a large number of microspores. 

4. Production of ovules and eggs
Seed plants are unique in retaining the megasporangium within
A layer of sporophyte tissue called integument envelops
megasporangium.
The entire structure, containing megasporangium, megaspore
called an ovule. Inside each ovule female gametophyte develop
and produces one or more eggs.
5. Production of pollen and sperms
A microspore develops into pollen grain that consists of a male
within the pollen wall. The wall of the pollen is tough as it is m
sporopollenin, which protects the pollen grain during pollina
pollen grain towards the ovule is called pollination. When a poll
rise to a pollen tube that discharges sperm (male gametes) into the
located within the ovule.
Inside a pollen grain, a sperm producing male gametophyte is p
seed plants do not require motility as they are carried directly in
tubes. Some gymnosperms retain the ancient flagellated condition
have been lost in the sperm of most gymnosperms and all Angio
hylum Gnetophyta
e.g. Gnetum
• Only gymnosperms have vessels in xylem
• Leaves of gymnosperms look like those of the flowering
plants. Their seeds, look like fruits of angiosperms.
Phylum Cycadophyta
• They have palm like leaves and large
cones
• They have flagellated sperms similar
to those of seedless vascular plants
e.g. Cycas 

Phylum Coniferophyta
e.g: Pinus
• Large trees are included such as Cyperes and Red
woods.
• In conifers two types of spores are produced by
separate cones.
Phylum Anthophyta - Angiosperms
Presence of flowers -
• Stamens produce microspores and these microspores develop into pollen grains
• These pollen grains contain male gametophyte/ gametes
• Carpels produce megaspores and these megaspores produce female gametophytes/
embryo sac
• Seeds are enclosed within the carpels
• Production of fruits- seeds are protected by fruits which help in their dispersal.
This is one of the unique features of phylum Anthophyta. A fruit typically consists
of a fertilized ovary and sometimes include other persistent floral parts. After
fertilization, the ovary wall thickens and develops into fruit. Ovules develop as
seed of the fruit. Thru fruit protects dormant seeds and aid in their dispersal.
Diversity of Angiosperms
The flowering plants (angiosperms) are divided into two groups based mainly on the
number of cotyledons in their embryo.
These two groups are;
1. Monocotyledons- species with one cotyledons
2. Dicotyledons- species with two cotyledons 

Monocotyledoneae, or monocots, are characterized by having embryos with a single cotyledon. They typically possess a fibrous root system and have leaves with parallel veins. The flower parts of monocots are usually trimerous, meaning they come in multiples of three. In monocot flowers, the perianth is present without a distinct calyx and corolla. Additionally, the pollen grains of monocots have a single opening (aperture), and their vascular bundles in the stem are scattered and lack cambia. Examples of monocots include grasses, coconuts, and rice.
Dicotyledoneae, or dicots, feature embryos with two cotyledons. They generally have a tap root system and exhibit reticulate (net-like) veins in their leaves. The flower parts in dicots are often pentamerous or tetramerous, occurring in multiples of five or four. Unlike monocots, dicot flowers have a distinct calyx and corolla. Pollen grains in dicots possess three openings (apertures), and their vascular bundles in the stem are arranged in a ring and include cambia. Common examples of dicots are rose, shoe flower, and cucurbits.","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"

35,Plant form and function,"Structure, Growth and Development of Plants","The main focus of this unit is on structure, growth and development of vascular plants.
Plants consist of a root system and a shoot system and roots and shoots grow at their
tips, which are with meristematic properties and called as apices, buds or meristems.
Types of plant tissues, structure- function relationship
A Tissue is a group of one or more cell types which carries out specialized function(s).
Meristems, locations and role in plant growth
Plants have undifferentiated tissues called meristems, consisting of cells which
constantly divide under suitable conditions and produce new cells. Some of these cells
then elongate and differentiate to produce new tissues of the plant body and others
remain as meristems. Meristems may have dormant periods. Due to the action of
meristem new cells are added. Subsequently these cells get differentiated and therefore
plant growth occurs by making new plant tissues.
Characteristics of meristematic cells
All cells in the meristems have common characteristics. They;
• are living cells
• are isodiametric (roughly spherical)
• are structurally and functionally undifferentiated
• have a central nucleus
• have a dense cytoplasm
• have ability to multiply
In meristem there are three overlapping zones of cells consisting of cells at successive
stages of
• cell division
• cell elongation and
• differentiation 

There are three types of meristems. They are;
1. apical meristems
2. lateral meristems
3. intercalary meristems
Apical meristems
These meristems are located at root tips and shoot tips. They add new cells that enable
increase in length. This process is known as primary growth.
Lateral meristems
Vascular cambium and cork cambium are lateral meristems. They are found in woody
plants and involve in the secondary growth in increasing circumference of roots and
stems. The vascular cambium produces secondary xylem and secondary phloem. The
cork cambium produces thick and tough periderm, replacing epidermis.
Intercalary meristems
Some monocots such as grasses show meristematic activity at the bases of stems and
leaves (nodes). These are known as intercalary meristems. They allow rapid regrowth
in damaged leaves.
Primary growth of roots
Elongation of root due to the activity of primary meristems located on root apex is
called primary growth of the root.
During the growth three processes take place.
i. Cell division - due to mitotic division.
ii. Cell elongation
iii. Cell maturation - due to differentiation.
These stages are found in three overlapping regions starting from meristems.
The zone of cell division includes the root apical meristem and its derivatives. In this
region, new cells are produced to both sides. Cells produced outward to the apical
meristem are differentiated to form root cap which prevents damaging the root apical
meristem from friction when grows through soil.
Cells produced inward to the meristem undergo elongation, in the zone of cell
elongation. Root cells elongate, sometimes to more than ten times their original length.
Hence the root is pushed forward through soil. 

In the zone of maturation, the cells begin specializing in structure and function where
cells complete their differentiation and become functionally mature. Primary structure
of the root is formed as a result of primary growth.
Primary growth of the shoot:
Elongation of shoot is due
to the activity of primary
meristem located in shoot
apex, and is called primary
growth of the shoot.
A shoot apical meristem
is a dome-shaped mass of
dividing cells located at the
shoot tip 

Leaves develop from leaf primordia, finger-like projections along the sides of the
apical meristems. Normally these primordia cover the shoot apical meristem.
Shoot apical meristem produces new cells only towards the stem, due to mitosis. After
cell elongation, cell differentiation takes place.
Then the primary tissues of the stem are formed due to cell differentiation. Therefore,
the height of the stem is increased due to primary growth. 

Differences between shoot apex and root apex 

The shoot apex is located at the tips of the shoots and is responsible for producing new cells that contribute to the growth of the shoot. It is protected by leaf primordia, which are the early stages of developing leaves. The shoot apex produces new cells primarily inwards, facilitating the elongation and development of the stem and leaves.
On the other hand, the root apex is found at the tip of the root and is covered by a root cap, which protects it as the root pushes through the soil. The root apex produces new cells in both directions, outward and inward, contributing to the growth of both the root cap and the root itself. This allows the root to expand and absorb nutrients efficiently.
Plant tissue systems
The new cells originating from the meristems are differentiated to perform specialized
functions and form a plant tissue system. During differentiation process, they undergo
changes in cytoplasm, organelles and cell wall. Therefore, several types of plant cells
can be recognized according to their structure and function.
A tissue consists of group of one or more cell types which carries out specialized
function(s).
Vascular plants have three main tissue systems. They are;
1. dermal tissue systems
2. ground tissue systems
3. vascular tissue systems
Dermal tissue system
This is the outer protective covering of plants.
e.g. Epidermis
• Protective layer in the stems and roots of the primary plant body and leaves
• Tightly packed single cell layer
• Normally covered by a cuticle which is a waxy epidermal coating in aerial parts
• Specialized cells such as guard cells, trichomes and root hairs are also found in
epidermis
Functions of epidermis:
• Defense against physical damage and pathogens
• Cuticle helps to prevent water loss 

• Root hairs involve in absorption of water and mineral ions
• Guard cells help gaseous exchange
• Trichomes (epidermal outgrowths such as hairs and glands) ;
o hair like trichomes reduce water loss, shiny hairs reflect excess light
o Some trichomes secrete chemicals involved in defense against insects/
pathogens/ herbivores,
Epidermis in older regions of stems and roots is replaced by a protective layer called
periderm after the secondary growth
Ground tissue system
Ground tissue fills the gap between dermal tissue and vascular tissue, mainly consists
of cortex (outer to vascular tissue) and pith (inner to vascular tissue). The ground tissue
includes cells specialized for functions such as storage, photosynthesis, support and
short distance transport.
Three main types of cells are present in ground tissue. They are;
1. parenchyma cells
2. collenchyma cells
3. sclerenchyma cells
Parenchyma cells
• Living even at functional maturity
• Mature cells have primary cell walls which are relatively thin, flexible and most
of the cells lack secondary walls
• They have a large central vacuole 

Functions
• Perform most of the metabolic functions of the plants.
e.g. synthesis of various organic products
• Storage e.g. some cells in root and stems contain plastids (leucoplasts) which
store starch.
• Most of the parenchyma cells retain the ability to divide and differentiate under
suitable conditions. This ability is important in wound repair. These abilities also
make it possible to multiply and differentiate cells even from a single parenchyma
cell in tissue culture practices.
Collenchyma cells
• They are generally elongated
• They have thicker primary walls than parenchyma cells
• Their walls are unevenly thickened
• Young stems and petioles often have strands of collenchyma cells just below the
epidermis
• Even at functional maturity they are living, flexible and elongating with stems
and leaves they support
Functions
• Give mechanical support to leaves and stems without restraining growth 

Sclerenchyma cells
• Secondary cell walls are produced after cell elongation
• They have secondary cell walls thickened by large amount of lignin
• They are dead cells at maturity
There are two types of sclerenchyma cells;
1. sclereids
2. fibers
Sclereids are shorter and wider than fibers and irregular in shape. They have very thick
lignifi ed secondary cell walls. They are found in places where growth has stopped e.g.
nut shells, seed coats and flesh of coarse fruit.
Fibers are usually grouped in strands. They are long, slender and tapered. Used
commercially to obtain fibers. E.g.: coconut husk fiber, hemp fibers
Functions
Sclereids and fibers are specialized to provide support and strength. 

Vascular tissues- Xylem and phloem
Xylem tissue
• It consists of vessel elements, tracheids, fibers and parenchyma cells in
angiosperms and some of the gymnosperms.
• Vessel elements and tracheids mainly conduct water.
• They are dead at functional maturity.
• Fibers give mechanical strength.
• Parenchyma functions in storage and in radial transportation. 

Vessel elements
• In all angiosperms and some gymnosperms, contain vessel elements
• They are cylindrical and long.
• They are wider, shorter and have thinner walls than tracheids
• Secondary walls are thickened by lignin
• They provide support to prevent collapse under tension of water transport
• Perforation plates are present at end walls of vessel elements. Other walls are
interrupted by pits
• They form xylem vessel by aligning end to end with perforation plates
• Water flows freely through perforation plates
Tracheids
• Found in all vascular plants
• Long, thin cells with tapering ends
• Secondary walls are thickened with lignin and often interrupted by pits
• Water moves from end to end through pits
• Thickening by lignin provides support to prevent collapse under water transport 

Phloem tissue
• It consist of sieve tube elements, companion cells, parenchyma cells and fibers
in angiosperms
• Except fibers other phloem cells are living cells
• In seedless vascular plants and gymnosperms sieve tube elements and companion
cells are absent. Instead of sieve tube elements, long narrow cells called sieve
cells are present in these plants.
Sieve tube elements
• Sieve tube elements lack nucleus, ribosomes, a distinct vacuole, and cytoskeletal
elements-
• cytoplasm reduced into a thin peripheral layer.
• Absence of these allow passing of nutrients more freely
• Chains of sieve tube elements are aligned to form sieve tubes
• The end walls between sieve tube elements contain porous plate called sieve
plate.
• Sieve plate allows movement of fluid from one sieve element to the next.
Companion cells
• They are non-conducting cells.
• Found alongside in each sieve tube element and connects with sieve tube element
by numerous plasmodesmata
• Nucleus and ribosomes of these cells also serve to adjacent sieve tube element
• Some companion cells in leaves help in phloem loading and in other organs

36,Plant form and function,Growth and development process of a plant,"Plant growth
Growth involves irreversible increase of dry mass associated with the development
of an organism. Often it is associated with increase of cell number as a result of
producing more cells from the meristem accompanied by cell elongation.
Plants continue growth throughout the life known as indeterminate growth.
Primary structure root
Apart of the distribution pattern of xylem and phloem tissue structures of both monocot
and dicot roots are more or less similar. 
• Outermost cell layer is epidermis. Cells have unicellular outgrowths called root
hairs. Epidermis protects inner parts while root hairs involve in the absorption
of water and minerals.
• Between epidermis and vascular cylinder there is a ground tissue known as
cortex which is made up of mostly parenchyma cells with intercellular spaces.
• Cortex mainly stores carbohydrates, and also ransports water and minerals
towards the endodermis.
• Innermost single cell layer of the cortex is the endodermis.
• Endodermis contains a suberin belt called casparian strip and no inter-cellular
spaces. Therefore, it blocks cortical apoplast from the vascular apoplast.
• Interior to endodermis there is a pericycle containing two or three parenchyma
cell layers. These cells in dicot roots have meristematic function and involve in
the formation of lateral roots and secondary growth of the root 
• Inner to pericycle there is vascular tissues as a solid core. Xylem can be found
in the middle and it is star shaped in a cross section of a dicot root. Phloem is
located in the groove between the arms of xylem.
• In monocot roots, vascular tissue consists of a central core of parenchyma cells
surrounded by a ring of alternating xylem and phloem. Pericycle in monocot
roots is not meristematic 

Primary structure of dicotyledonous plant stem :

• The outermost epidermal cell layer protects inner parts from desiccation and
infections. The epidermis is interrupted by pores called stomata.
• Interior to epidermis is cortex mostly containing parenchyma cells.
• Collenchyma cells may also be present just beneath the epidermis to provide
strength.
• Sclerenchyma such as fibers are also present in the cortex to provide additional
support.
• Vascular bundles arranged as a ring. Vascular bundle contains primary phloem
towards cortex primary xylem towards pith and in-between a cambium tissue.
• Outside vascular bundle, there is a cluster of sclerenchyma cell.
• Inner to vascular bundles large pith which is also made up of parenchyma cells
can be found.
• Lateral shoots develop from axillary buds.

Primary structure of the monocotyledonous stem:

• Ground tissue of monocot shoot is not differentiated into cortex and pith
• The vascular bundles are scattered throughout the ground tissue in most monocot
stems.
• Each vascular bundle is surrounded by sclerenchyma. It consists of a xylem
tissue and a phloem tissue but no cambium inbetween xylem and phloem.
Secondary growth :
• Increase in the diameter of stems and roots in plants due to the new cells produced
by lateral meristems is called secondary growth.
• This occurs in stems and roots of woody perennial plants including, all
gymnosperms species and many dicot species.
• Lateral meristems, namely vascular cambium and cork cambium produce cells
and tissues in the secondary growth.
• The vascular cambium adds secondary xylem (wood) towards primary xylem
and secondary phloem towards primary phloem, increasing vascular flow and
support for the shoots.
• The cork cambium produces tough thick covering consisting mainly of wax
impregnated cells that protect the stem from water loss and from invasion of
insects, bacteria and fungi.
• In woody plants, primary growth and secondary growth occur simultaneously.
As the primary growth adds new cells and lengthens stems and roots in the
younger regions of a plant, secondary growth increases the diameter of stems
and roots inolder regions where. primary growth has ceased. 
• Secondary vascular tissue is produced by the action of vascular cambium.
• In a typical woody stem, the vascular cambium consists of a continuous cylinder
of undifferentiated cells of often only a single cell layer in thickness, located
outside the pith and primary xylem and to the inside of the cortex and primary
phloem.
• In a typical woody root, the vascular cambium forms laterally exterior to the
primary xylem and interior to the primary phloem and pericycle.
• As these meristematic cells divides they increase circumference of the vascular
cambium and also add secondary xylem to the inside of the cambium and
secondary phloem to the outside.
• Viewed in a cross section, the vascular cambium appears as a ring of initials.
• Some initials are elongated and are oriented with their long axis parallel to the
axis of stem or root.
• They produce cells such as tracheids, vessel elements, parenchyma and fibers of
the xylem, as well as sieve-tube elements companion cells, phloem fibers and
phloem parenehyma.
• The other initials are shorter and oriented perpendicular to the axis of the stem
or root.
• They produce vascular rays-mostly parenchyma cells that connect secondary
xylem and phloem, store carbohydrates and aid in wound repairing.
• As the secondary growth continues over many years, layers of secondary xylem
(wood) accumulate.
• The walls of the secondary xylem cells are heavily lignified and account for the
hardness and strength of wood.
• During early stages of secondary growth, the epidermis pushed outwards, causing
it to split, dry and falls off the stem or root.
• It is replaced by two tissues produced by cork cambium, a cylinder of dividing
cells that arises in the outer layer of cortex in stems and in the outer layer of
pericycle in the roots.
• Cork cambium produces cork cells to exterior.
• Cork cambium and tissues it produces are collectively called periderm
• As the cork cells mature, they deposit a waxy, hydrophobic material called
suberin in their walls and they become dead cells.
• The cork tissues function as a barrier that helps protect the stem or root from
water loss, physical damages and pathogens.
• Each cork cambium and the tissues it produces comprise a layer of periderm
which is impermeable to water and gasses.
• For gaseous exchange small pores are present in the periderm known as lenticels
which are formed by loosely arranged cork cells. They appear as horizontal slits.
• Further growth of stem or root breaks the layer of cork cambium and it lacks its
meristematic activity and its cells become cork cells
• A new cork cambium is initiated inside which with produce a new layer of
periderm.
• As new cells are added, the outer regions of cork will crack and peel off in many
tree trunks.
• Due to the tissue layers produced by vascular cambium and cork cambium, girth
of the stem or root increases in secondary growth.
• Bark is all tissues out of the vascular cambium (cork is commonly and incorrectly
referred to as bark). Its main components are secondary phloem and periderm.

Heart Wood and Sap wood:
• As a woody plant ages, the older layers of secondary xylem no longer transport
water and minerals.
• These layers are called heartwood because they are close to the centre of the
stem or root.
• The newest outer layers of secondary xylem, still transport xylem sap are known
as sapwood.
• The heartwood is generally darker than sapwood because of resins and other
compounds that permeate the cell cavities and help protect the core of the tree
from fungi and wood-boring insects.
• Only the young secondary phloem functions in phloem translocation and old
secondary phloem is sloughed off.
Hard wood and soft wood
• Hard wood is the secondary xylem of dicot angiosperms while wood of
gymnosperms are named soft wood
• Xylem vessels are absent in soft wood
Growth rings:
• The thickness of secondary xylem and the lumen of vessels are larger in periods
of warm and wet seasons compared to other growth season of the year. These
differences are visible in a cross section as lighter and darker rings. These are
referred as growth rings.
• In temperate regions, wood that develops early in spring is known as spring
wood. This xylem tissue consists of xylem vessels with large lumens and thin
walls. This structure maximizes delivery of water to new leaves.
• The wood produced during rest of the growing season is called summer wood.
These xylem tissues consist of xylem vessels with thick walls and small lumen,
do not transport much water but provide more support.
• These two woods collectively known as an annual ring. A year’s growth appears
as distinct ring in the cross section of most tree trunks and roots. Therefore
age of the tree can be estimated by counting annual rings in trees growing in
temperate regions.
Shoot, architecture and light capture
• Length of the stem and branching pattern are designed to capture maximum
light.
• Plants grow tall to avoid shading from neighboring plants. 
Stem
• Most tall plants have thick stem with strong mechanical support.
• Woody plants undergo secondary growth thereby make their tall stem stronger.
• Vines rely on other objects to reach higher levels to capture more light.
Branching pattern
• There is a variety in branching pattern.
• Some plants are unbranched and still others are well branched.
• This variation in branching pattern enables the plant to absorb maximum light in
the ecological niche it occupies.
Leaves
Leaf size
• Size of the leaf vary, based on the place where the plant grows.
• Largest leaves are found in plants growing in rain forests.
• Smallest leaves are found in plant species inhabiting dry or very cold environments.
Phyllotaxy
• This is the arrangement of leaves on the stem.
• The arrangement may be one leaf, two leaves or several leaves per node.
• Phyllotaxy helps the plant to capture maximum sunlight.
Leaf orientation
• Leaves may be horizontally oriented.
• They capture light efficiently in low light conditions.
• Some plants have vertically arranged leaves. e.g. Grasses
• This is to avoid the possible damage caused by exposure of leaf to the over
intense light. When leaves are nearly vertical, light rays are parallel to the leaf
surfaces, so no leaves receive too much of light. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
37,Plant form and function,Process of Gaseous Exchange in Plants,"Anatomy of typical dicot and monocot leaves
In most vascular plants, leaves are the main photosynthetic organs. The exchange of
gases occurs through stomata in the upper and lower epidermis. Epidermis is usually
a single cell layer. In between the upper and lower epidermis, there is a ground
tissue called the mesophyll. This tissue consists of parenchyma cells, specialized for
photosynthesis. 

In dicot leaves, stomata are, mainly found in the lower epidermis. The mesophyll
consists of two distinct layers called palisade and spongy. Palisade mesophyll consists
of elongated cells that are arranged in one or more layers. This can be found in the
upper part of the leaf, just beneath the upper epidermis.
The spongy mesophyll can be found between the palisade layer and lower epidermis.
They are loosely arranged with many air spaces. Spongy mesophyll cells have less
chloroplasts than in palisade mesophyll cells.
The vascular tissue of the leaf is continuous with vascular tissue of the stem. Veins
in the leaf is highly branched (net like venation) in the mesophyll layer. Each vein is
protected by a bundle sheath layer.
In monocot leaves, stomata are present in both lower and upper epidermis. Mesophyll
is not differentiated into palisade and spongy layers. Chloroplasts are abundant in all
mesophyll cells. Veins are parallelly arranged (parallel venation) 

Structure of Stomata
Stomata are pores surrounded by guard cells in the epidermis of the leaves and stems
of plants which can open and close. Guard cells are modified epidermal cells which
have a distinct shape and are the only epidermal cells that contain chloroplasts. Guard
cells are typically bean shaped in angiosperms. The guard cell walls are unevenly
thickened. The inner cellulose wall is thicker and less elastic than the outer wall. Some
of the cellulose microfibrils are radially arranged to form inelastic hoops around guard
cells.
Guard cells regulate the diameter of the stomata by changing shape, widening or
narrowing the gap between the pair of guard cells. 

Gaseous exchange
Gaseous exchange is the exchange of gases between the cells of the organism and
the environment. In plants gaseous exchange is possible via stomata and lenticels. In
addition to these a small amount of gases can be exchanged via cuticle. There is no
special system within plants for the transport of O2and CO2.These gases move entirely
by diffusion. 

Mechanism of opening and closing of stomata
Stomatal opening and closing depends on changes in turgor of the guard cells. If water
flows into the cells by osmosis their turgor increases, and they expand, but they do not
expand uniformly in all directions. The relatively inelastic inner walls make them bend
and draw away from each other. The result is that the pore opens. If the guard cells
lose water, the reverse happens- their turgor decreases, and their inner walls become
straighter thus closing the pore.
The K+ influx hypothesis explains the mechanism.
K+ influx hypothesis
During the day time, the guard cells actively accumulate K+ from neighboring
epidermal cells, thus lowering their water potential that leads to the inflow of water by
osmosis from the surrounding epidermal cells. As a result the turgor pressure in guard
cells increase, opening stomata.
The accumulation of K+ in the guard cells requires the energy which is provided by the
transfer of electrons during photosynthesis of the chloroplast in guard cells.
Stomatal closing occurs by loss of K+ from guard cells to neighbouring epidermal
cells. It leads to exosmosis of water from guard cells. As a result the turgor pressure in
guard cells decrease, closing stomata.
Abscisic acid (ABA) also plays a role in K+ influx mechanism
Role of ABA in stomatal closure in drought
• ABA is produced in roots and leaves in response to water deficiency.
• Production of ABA leads to close the stomata by removal of K+ in guard cells.
• This prevents the wilting of the plant.
Factors affecting stomatal action
• Stomata open during day and mostly closed at night. Light stimulates accumulation
of K+ in guard cells.
• Decrease in CO
2 concentration in substomatal cavity lead to open stomata
• Internal clock in the guard cells controlling their daily rhythm of opening and
closing of stomata.
• Environmental stresses such as drought, high temperature and wind can cause
stomata to close during the day time. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
38,Plant form and function,Acquisition of water and minerals,"Need for transport
As land plants evolved and increased in number, competition for light, water and
nutrients also increased. As a result, the size and complexity of plant body increased.
Therefore the simple ways of transportation of water and material became inadequate
leading to the evolution of vascular tissues, consisting of xylem and phloem to carryout
long distance transport in plants.
e.g. the xylem transports water and minerals from roots to shoots.
the phloem transports products of photosynthesis from where they are made or
stored to where they are needed.
Methods of water and solutes movement
Both active and passive transport mechanisms occur in plants
• Active transport
• Passive transport
• Diffusion
• Osmosis
• Imbibitions
• Facilitated diffusion
• Bulk flow- long distance
Passive transport occurs spontaneously, and it does not require metabolic energy (ATP).
Movement of some materials across membranes takes place using ATP and that process
is called an active transport.
Diffusion
Molecules have an energy called thermal energy, due to their constant motion. One
result of this motion is diffusion.
In the absence of other forces, the movement of molecules of a substance from a place
where it is more concentrated to place where it is less concentrated, due to random
motion of molecules is called diffusion.
The motion of a molecule is random, but movement of a population of molecules by
diffusion is directional.
Therefore, diffusion takes place according to a concentration gradient, spontaneously
and not using metabolic energy (ATP).
Diffusion takes place across the membrane also, if the membrane is permeable to those
molecules.
e.g. Water and soluble materials can diffuse through the cellulose cell wall
O
2 and CO2 can diffuse through the plasma membrane 

Osmosis
Osmosis is a special type of diffusion. The diffusion of free water molecules across a
selectively permeable membrane is called osmosis.
Free water is water molecules that are not bound to solutes or surfaces.
Imbibition
The physical adsorption of water molecules by hydrophilic materials is called
imbibition.
e.g. adsorption of water molecules by the cellulose cell walls.
Facilitated diffusion
Movement of water and hydrophilic solutes across the membranes passively with the
help of transport protein that span the membrane is called facilitated diffusion.
Transport proteins are very specific. They transport some substances but not the
others. This movement also takes place along concentration gradient and it is a passive
movement. 

Bulk flow
Bulk flow is the movement of liquid and the materials (entire solution) in response to
pressure gradient. Always the bulk flow transports materials from higher pressure to
lower pressure region.
It is a long-distance transport method. This flow does not occur through the membranes
and occurs at much greater speed than diffusion. This method of transport is independent
of solute concentration gradient. 

Concept of water potential
The physical property that predicts the direction in which water will flow governed by
solute concentration and applied pressure is called water potential. Water potential is
related to potential energy of water molecules.
Any system that contains water has a water potential. Free water moves from regions
of higher water potential to regions of lower water potential, if there is no barrier to
its flow.
Water potential is denoted by ?. ? is measured in a unit of megapascal (MPa). Arbitrary
the ? of pure water in a container open to the atmosphere under standard conditions (at
sea level and room temperature) is 0 MPa.
Both solute concentration and physical pressure can affect water potential; as expressed
in the water potential equation.
? =?s + ?p
?= water potential
?s= solute potential
?p= pressure potential
Solute potential
Solute potential is directly proportional to the molarity of a solution. (?s is also
called osmotic potential. Solutes affect the direction of osmosis.)
The solutes in plants are typically mineral ions and sugars.
? of pure water is 0 MPa.
When solutes are added, they bind water molecules and reduce free water molecules,
reducing capacity of the water to move and do work.
In this way an increase in solutes has a negative effect on water potential. Therefore,
?s of a solution is always expressed as a negative number. As the solute concentration
increases, ?s will become more negative.
e.g: ?s of the 0.1M sugar solution is -0.23MPa
Pressure potential
Pressure potential (?p) is the physical pressure on a solution. ?p can be positive or
negative relative to atmospheric pressure.
e.g: ?p of a xylem vessel is usually less than -2 MPa as xylem vessels are under
tension (negative pressure)
?p of a living cell is a positive value because living cell is usually under positive
pressure due to osmotic uptake of water.
The cell contents press the plasma membrane against the cell wall. Then press against
the protoplast, producing a pressure called turgor pressure. When turgor pressure
increases, the ? of cell also increases. 

Water potential of a cell
Cell is a system containing water. Therefore, it has a water potential. The protoplast
is an aqueous system and it contains solutes. Therefore, it has a solute potential (?s)
which is negative. Because of ?s, ? of the cell is decreased.
Due to the turgor pressure internal pressure of protoplast increases and increases
pressure potential (?p) of the cell. Because of ?p, ? of cell increased.
Therefore, water potential (?) of a cell is given by the following equation.
?= ?s +?p
Entry of water into vacuolated cell across the cell membrane
If a cell is placed in a solution, direction of water movement depends on the water
potential of external solution and protoplast.
Take a fully flaccid cell; (as a result of water losing)
The ?p of that cell is 0;
?p= 0 ;?s= ?
?s of pure water is 0 and addition of solutes will increase the negative value of ?s or
become more negative. Suppose this flaccid cell is placed in a solution of higher solute
concentration (more negative solute potential) than the cell itself, since the external
solution has a lower (more negative) water potential, water diffuse out of the cell. The
protoplast of the cell shrinks and pulls away from the cell wall. This process is known
as plasmolysis.
Suppose this flaccid cell is placed in pure water (?=0 MPa). The cell has a lower water
potential than the pure water as it contains solutes. Therefore, water enters the cell by
osmosis. Then the protoplast of the cell begins to swell and press the plasma membrane
against the cell wall. The partially elastic cell, exerting a turgor pressure, contains
the pressurized protoplast. Therefore, ?p is increased gradually. The maximum value
of ?p= ?s of the cell. Therefore, ? becomes 0. This matches the water potential of
extracellular environment, 0 Mpa. Then a dynamic equilibrium is formed and there is
no further net water movement. If the cell has the maximum value for ?p, (it equal to
the ?s of the cell) the cell is said to be in fully turgid state. (fully turgid or fully flaccid
cells are not found in nature).
Therefore, if non-woody tissue is placed in a solution with higher water potential, it
is stiffened and is very rigid. Therefore, turgor pressure helps support of non woody
plants. Turgor pressure is also important in cell elongation. Loss of turgor results in
wilting, a condition where leaves and stem droop.
Movement of water and minerals from soil solution to plant root
The cells near the root tips of the roots are important because most of the absorption
of water and minerals occurs there. In this region, the epidermal cells are permeable 

to water and many are differentiated to root hairs. Root hairs account for much of the
absorption of water by roots, due to increase in surface area.
The root hairs absorb the soil solution, which consists of water molecules and
dissolved mineral ions that are not bound tightly to soil particles. This absorption takes
place across the plasma membrane. Water can enter root hair by osmosis, a passive
movement along the concentration gradient.
But in the root hairs concentration of mineral ions is greater than that of soil solution.
K+ concentration in the root hair is hundreds of time greater than in the soil solution.
Therefore, mineral ions transport occurs against concentration gradient, by an active
transport.
The soil solution is also absorbed into hydrophilic walls of the epidermal cells and
passes freely along the cell walls and the extracellular spaces into the root cortex. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
39,Plant form and function,Radial transport,"Transport of water and minerals entered from soil to root cortex into the xylem of the
root is known as radial transport.
The endodermis, the innermost layer of cells in the cortex, functions as the last check
point for selective passage of the minerals from the cortex into the vascular cylinder.
All materials which enters root through cell walls and extracellular spaces should
cross the membranes of endodermis. Therefore, unwanted materials can be selectively
excluded.
Three routes are used in the radial transport. They are:
1. apoplastic route
2. symplastic route
3. transmembrane route
Apoplastic route
The apoplastic route consists of everything external to the plasma membrane of living
cells and includes cell walls, extracellular spaces and the interior of dead cells such as
vessel elements and tracheids.
Water and solutes move along continuum of the cell walls and extracellular spaces and
it is known as apoplastic route.
Uptake of soil solution by the hydrophilic walls of root hairs provides access to the
apoplast. Water and minerals then can diffuse into cortex along this matrix of walls and
extracellular spaces.
Endodermis blocks apoplastic route by a barrier located in the transverse and radial
walls of endodermal cells, called the casparian strips. It is a belt made of suberin which
is impervious to water and mineral salts. Thus water and minerals cannot cross the
endodermis and enter the vascular cylinder via apoplast. Therefore, water and minerals 

cross the selectively permeable plasma membrane before entering the vascular tissue
and keep unneeded and toxic materials out.
The endodermis also prevents solutes that have accumulated in the xylem from leaking
back into the soil solution.
Symplastic route
The symplast consists of the entire mass of cytosol of all living cells in a plant, as well
as plasmodesmata, the cytoplasmic channels that interconnect them.
In the symplastic route, water and solutes move along the continuum of cytosol. This
route requires substance to cross a plasma membrane once, when they first enter the
plant. After entering one cell, substances can move from cell to cell via plasmodesmata.
Transmembrane route
The transmembrane route requires repeated crossing of plasma membranes as water
and solutes exit one cell and enter the next.
As the soil solution moves along the apoplast, some water and minerals are transported
into the protoplast of the cells of the epidermis and cortex and then move via the
symplast.
Some substances can use more than one route. The least resistence for the transport is
found in apoplastic route. Therefore, more water use apoplastic route.
Finally, water and minerals enter into the tracheids and vessel elements of xylem. These
waters conducting cells lack protoplasts when mature and therefore they are parts of the
apoplast. Endodermal cells and living cells of the vascular tissues discharge minerals
from their protoplast to their own cell walls. Both diffusion and active transport involve
in transport of solutes from symplast to apoplast. Then water and minerals can enter
the tracheids and vessel elements to the transport to shoot system by bulk flow only
through the apoplast.
Upward movement of water and minerals in a plant
Water and minerals which enter to vascular cylinder are transported to upper parts of
the plant and this transport is known as ascent of xylem sap.
Xylem sap, the water and dissolved minerals in the xylem, gets transported by bulk
flow, which is much faster than diffusion.
To explain the process involved in the ascent of xylem sap, cohesion-tension hypothesis
is put forward. According to this hypothesis, transpiration provides pull for the ascent
of xylem sap and cohesion of water molecules transmits this pull along the entire
length of xylem from shoots to roots. Hence xylem sap is normally under tension
(negative pressure).
The negative pressure potential helps water to move up through xylem and water
moves according to the water potential gradient.
Adhesion and cohesion facilitate transport water by bulk flow. Due to high adhesion
water molecules are attracted to cellulose molecules in the xylem walls. Cohesion of
water molecules is unusually high due to hydrogen bonds among water molecules.
Therefore, a continuous water column is formed within xylem vessels and tracheids.
Transpiration pull can extend down to the root only through an unbroken chain of
water.
As water evaporates from the mesophyll cells, water potential of mesophyll reduces,
and water moves from cells of petioles to the mesophyll cells. It reduces the water
potential of cells of petioles. then water pulls upward due to this transpiration pull.
The xylem sap is driven by difference in pressure potential. Therefore, the water
potential gradient within xylem is essentially a pressure gradient.
The tensile force on xylem sap is transmitted all the way from the leaves to the root tips
and even into the soil. Therefore, water potential gradient between the soil solution and
atmosphere through the plant body also help ascent of xylem sap, against the gravity.
The plants do not need energy to lift the xylem sap.
Mechanism of mineral absorption into root
Mineral ions are absorbed by the plant roots mainly from the soil solution. Epidermal
cells are permeable to water and many epidermal cells are modified to form root hairs.
Root hair cells are unicellular structures which absorb dissolved mineral ions from the
soil solution. Soil solution has a lower concentration of ions than that of the cell sap
of root hair cells. Therefore, absorption takes place against a concentration gradient. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
40,Plant form and function,The process involved in transport of material in phloem,"Basic characteristics of phloem transport
The transport of the product of photosynthesis is carried out by the phloem tissue,
known as phloem translocation.
In angiosperms, the sieve-tube elements of the phloem are specialized cells for
translocation.
Phloem sap, the aqueous solution that flows through sieve tubes differs from xylem
sap mainly because it contains sucrose (as 30% by weight) and it may also contain
amino acids, hormones and minerals.
Phloem sap moves from sites of sugar production to site of sugar use or storage.
Therefore, it takes place from sugar source to a sugar sink.
Sugar source is an organ that is a net producer of sugar, by photosynthesis or by
breakdown of starch.
Plant leaves are sources whereas growing roots, stems, buds and fruits are sinks 

Storage organs such as tubers and bulbs, may be a source or a sink, depending on its
function.
Mechanism of phloem translocation
Sinks usually receive sugar from the nearest sugar sources. For each sieve tube, the
direction of transport depends on the locations of the sugar source and sugar sink
that are connected by that tube. Therefore, neighbouring sieve tubes may carry sap in
opposite directions if they originate and end in different locations.
The first step in translocation of sugar is to transport or load into sieve tube elements.
In some species, it moves from mesophyll cells to sieve tube elements via symplast,
passing through plasmodesmata.
In many plants, sugar movements into phloem requires active transport because sucrose
is more concentrated in sieve tube element and companion cells than mesophyll cells.
Sucrose is unloaded at the sink end of the sieve tube. The process varies by species
and organ. However, the concentration of free sugar in sink is always lower than in
the sieve tube because the unloaded sugar is consumed during growth and metabolism
of cells of sinks or converted to insoluble polymers such as starch. As a result of
concentration gradient, sugar molecules diffuse from phloem into the sink and water
follows by osmosis.
Phloem sap moves from source to sink at a rate about 1m/hr and it moves by bulk flow
driven by positive pressure, known as pressure flow.
Phloem translocation of angiosperms is explained by pressure flow hypothesis. In this
translocation, following processes take place.
1. Loading of sugar into the sieve tube reduces water potential inside the sieve tube
elements at the source
2. This causes the sieve tube to take up water from the xylem by osmosis.
3. This uptake of water generates a positive pressure that forces the sap to flow along
the tube
4. The pressure is reduced by unloading of sugar and consequent loss of water from
phloem to the xylem at the sink 

Process of water loss in plants
Transpiration
Removal of water from leaves and other aerial parts of the plant body as water vapour
by diffusion is known as transpiration.
This water loss takes place in plants mainly;
through stomata.-stomatal transpiration
upto some extent through cuticle-cuticular transpiration
and through lenticels- lenticular transpiration.
About 95% of water in plants is lost through stomatal transpiration.
In the day time, air in the intercellular air spaces is saturated with water vapour because
they are in contact with the moist cell walls. Normally air outside the plant is drier than
inside. Hence water potential of outside air is lower than that of inside. Therefore
water vapour in the air spaces of the plant diffuses down its water potential gradient
and exits the plant.
Stomatal Transpiration
Water is brought to the leaf in the xylem of vascular bundle and subsequently spread
from a fi ne branching network throughout the leaf. These branches end in one or
few xylem vessels or tracheids possessing little lignification. Therefore water can
release easily through their cellulose walls to mesophyll cells. Water moves through 

the mesophyll cells by apoplast, symplast and transmembrane pathways according to
water potential gradient.
Then water evaporate from the wet walls of the mesophyll cells into the intercellular
air spaces particularly into the large substomatal air spaces. From here water vapour
diffuses through the stomata to the atmosphere.
Immediately next to the leaf is a thin layer of stationary air through which water vapour
diffuses out and swept away by moving air.
There is a diffusion gradient from the stationary layer back to the mesophyll cells.
Each stomata has a diffusion gradient or diffusion shell around it. The diffusion shell
of neighbouring stomata overlap in still air to form one overall diffusion shell (Layer).
Thickness of the diffusion shell depends on the surface features of the leaf and wind
speed.
Factors affecting the rate of transpiration
1. Light intensity
2. Temperature
3. Humidity
4. Wind speed
5. Concentration of CO
2
6. Available water in soil
Light intensity
Stomata usually open in the light and close in darkness. With the increase of light
intensity the rate of transpiration increases.
Temperature
In the presence of light, the external factor which has the greatest effect on transpiration
is temperature. The higher the temperature, the greater the rate of evaporation of water
from mesophyll cells which result the greater saturation of the leaf atmosphere with
water vapour. At the same time, a rise in temperature lowers the relative humidity of
the air outside the leaf. Both events result in a steeper concentration gradient of water
molecules from leaf to external atmosphere. The steeper this gradient is the faster the
rate of diffusion.
Humidity
Low humidity outside environment of the leaf increases transpiration, because it
makes the diffusion gradient of water vapour from the moist leaf atmosphere to drier 

external atmosphere. As the concentration of water vapour in the external atmosphere
is high when humidity rises, the diffusion gradient becomes less steep result in lower
transpiration.
Wind speed
In still air, a shell of highly saturated air builds up around the leaf thus reducing the
steepness of the diffusion gradient between leaf atmosphere and external atmosphere
which makes the transpiration rate low.
In windy condition, flow of air will generally sweep away the shell. Therefore, windy
condition increases transpiration rate.
Availability of soil water
As soil dries out, water usually binds more tightly to soil particles reducing the amount
of available water. The soil solution becomes more concentrated and its water potential
decreases. Therefore, tendency for water to enter by osmosis is lower. This reduces
water uptake by plants and as a result transpiration rate is also reduced. There is greater
resistance to movement of water through the plant due to less steep water potential
gradient from the soil through the plant to the atmosphere.
Signifi cance of transpiration to plants
1. Distribute minerals and water throughout the plant.
2. Ascent of water in the xylem.
3. Uptake of water and minerals by roots from the soil solution.
Root pressure and guttation
At night, when the relative humidity is high approaching 100%, transpiration rate is
very low or zero. Root cells continuously pump water and mineral ions into xylem
tissue. The endodermis prevents ions from leaking back into the cortex and soil.
Therefore more mineral ions accumulate in the vascular cylinder and reduce water
potential. Therefore water moves from the cortex. It generates a root pressure and
upward push of xylem sap.
Due to root pressure, more water enters to the leaves than lost by transpiration. This
results in removal of water droplets from leaf tips or leaf margins of some herbaceous
plants. That process is known as guttation. Guttation fluid differs from dew, which is
condensed moisture of the atmosphere.
Many plants do not generate any root pressure and therefore there is no guttation.
Even in plants that display guttation, root pressure cannot match the water loss by
transpiration after sun rise and therefore no guttation is seen in the day time, because
then xylem sap is not pushed but pulled upward by transpiration. 
Root pressure is never sufficient to push water up distance over meters. Guttation takes
place through the hydathode which are formed by special groups of cells located near
the ends of small veins and does not take place through the stomata.

Autotrophic nutrition (autotrophism)
The organisms who exhibit autotrophism are referred to as autotrophs. Autotrophs
synthesize organic materials from CO2 and inorganic materials.
Plants are photoautotrophs which utilizes light energy in order to synthesize organic
molecules from inorganic material.
• Symbiosis
Symbiosis is an ecological relationship in which two species live in close contact with
each other. There are three types; they are mutualism, parasitism, and commensalism.
• Mutualism
A symbiotic relationship in which both participants are benefi ted.

• Commensalism
It is an interaction between two species in which benefi ts one of the species and neither
harm nor benefi ts the other.
e.g: epiphytic orchids
• Parasitism
It is a close association between two different species which is benefi cial to one (the
parasite) and harmful to the other (the host).
e.g. semi parasitic–Loranthus and host plant
parasitic - Cuscuta (Dodder plant) and host plants
• Special mode of nutrition

digesting insects and other small animals. They live in habitats where the soil is poor
in nitrogen and other minerals.
e.g : Nepenthes, Drosera , Utricularia

Micronutrients
Plants require these elements in small amounts.
e.g: Cl, Fe, Mn, B, Zn, Cu, Ni, Mo 

Macro elements and their functions and defi ciency symptoms 

Carbon (C) is taken in as CO2 from atmospheric air and forms a major component of organic molecules in plants. A deficiency results in poor growth. Similarly, Oxygen (O), also absorbed as CO2 from air and soil solution, is vital for organic molecules in plants, with deficiency leading to stunted growth. Hydrogen (H) is absorbed as H2O from soil solution, contributing to organic molecules and leading to wilting if deficient.
Nitrogen (N) is taken up as NO3- or NH4+ from the soil, essential for amino acids, proteins, and chlorophyll. Deficiency leads to stunted growth and chlorosis in older leaves. Potassium (K), in the form of K+, is necessary for enzyme activation and stomatal function, and its deficiency results in yellow leaf margins, weak stems, and poor root development.
Calcium (Ca) is absorbed as Ca2+, playing a role in cell wall structure and membrane maintenance. Deficiency causes crinkled leaves and death of terminal buds. Magnesium (Mg), taken in as Mg2+, is a component of chlorophyll and activates enzymes; deficiency leads to chlorosis in older leaves.
Phosphorus (P), absorbed as H2PO4-, is part of ATP and nucleic acids, with deficiency causing slow growth, thin stems, and poor flowering. Sulfur (S), taken as SO4-2, forms amino acids, with chlorosis in younger leaves when deficient.
Other elements like Chlorine (Cl) (important for osmosis and ionic balance), Iron (Fe) (involved in chlorophyll synthesis), Zinc (Zn) (activating enzymes and chlorophyll formation), Boron (B) (for cell wall function), Copper (Cu) (activating enzymes), Molybdenum (Mo) and Nickel (Ni) (involved in nitrogen metabolism), and Manganese (Mn) (activating photosynthesis enzymes) are also critical. Deficiencies in these elements lead to various symptoms, such as leaf discoloration, chlorosis, crinkled leaves, stunted growth, or death of plant tips.","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"

• The life cycles of all land plants exhibit alternation of generations, which means
the presence of haploid generation and diploid generation alternatively, with
each producing the other.
• The two multicellular body forms that alternate in the life cycles of land plants
are the haploid gametophyte and diploid sporophyte which are morphologically
different. Therefore called heteromorphic alternation of generations. Their
reproductive organs (gametangia and sporangia) are protected by sterile cell
layers to prevent desiccation of mother cells. (gamete forming cells and spore
forming cells).
• Gametophytes produce gametes by mitosis.
• All land plants carryout internal fertilization to prevent desiccation of gametes.
• Female egg (ovum) is retained in the archegonium and male gametes

into the archegonium and fertilizes the egg (n) resulting in a zygote(2n).
• Zygote develops to form an embryo and then embryo develops to form a young
sporophyte by obtaining nutrients from the female gametophyte.
• Sporophyte generation is the larger and more complex form in the alternation of
generation
Life cycle of Cycas
• Sporophytes are the dominant photosynthetic plants in the life cycle, gametophytes
are reduced and depend on the sporophyte throughout its life.
• Sporophytes are a perennial tree with roots, stem and leaves.
• Stem is unbranched columnar and woody.
• Leaves are arranged in crowns.
• Compound leaves show xerophytic adaptations and young leaves are fiddleheads.
• Sporophytes are heterosporous and dioecious. Sporophytes have developed a tap
root system.
• Secondary growth is present.
• Sporophytes which produce megaspores are called female plants and those
which produce microspores are called male plants.
• Mature female plant produces a crown of megasporophylls.
• Megasporangium is enclosed in the protective layer called integument to form
the ovule. Integument has a small pore in the distal end of the ovule called
micropyle.
• One of the cells in the megasporangial tissue differentiates into a single
megaspore mother cell. Megaspore mother cell undergoes meiosis to form four
haploid megaspores out of which only one remains functional.
• The remaining megasporangial tissue functions as nucellus which provides
nourishment.
• Megaspores are not released to the external environment megaspore develop
into the female gametophyte (n) while within the ovule. Mature ovule contains
the female gametophyte. The female gametophyte produces several archegonia.
Each archegonium produces a single egg cell within it.
• Mature male plants produce male cones with microsporophylls which consist
of microsporangia on the lower surface. Large numbers of microspores (n) are
produced from microspore mother cells (2n) within the microsporangium by
meiosis. 
• They develop into pollen grains within the sporangium and then discharge.
• Pollen grains are dispersed by wind and deposited on the micropyle of a mature
ovule is called pollination.
• Pollen grains enter into pollen chamber of the ovule through the micropyle.
In the pollen chamber, pollen grains develop into male gametophytes. Male
gametophyte consists of a branched pollen tube which involves in absorption of
nutrients from the nucellus. Male gametophyte is short-lived.
• Produce two large sperms with a spiral band of numerous cilia.
• The basal end of the pollen tube ruptures releasing sperms into the archegonial
chamber of the ovule. Sperms swim through the liquid medium and fertilize the
egg resulting the 2n zygote.
• Zygote develops into the embryo
• Remaining female gametophyte becomes the endosperm which providesnutrients
for the developing embryo during seed germination. Integument becomes the
seed coat.
• The ovule becomes the seed.
• Seed is the dispersal unit which contains the embryo and stored food that are
enclosed in the seed coat.
• Seeds are dispersed and under favorable environmental conditions seeds
germinate producing the seedlings (young Sporophyte) ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
43,Evolution and Diversity of Organisms,"Structures and functions associated with sexual reproduction in
flowering plants","Life cycle of flowering plants
• Sporophyte is the dominant plant. Gametophytes are short-lived, microscopic,
entirely depend on the sporophyte.
• Sporophyte produces the reproductive structures called flowers.
• A flower is a specialized shoot with four whorls of modified leaves named sepals,
petals, stamens and carpels.
• Sepals are usually green, enclose and protect the flower before it opens.
• Petals are brightly coloured in most flowers and aid in attracting pollinators. (But
wind pollinated flowers generally lack brightly coloured parts).
• The sepals and petals are sterile floral organs. They do not directly involve in
reproduction.
• Stamens are the microsporophylls.
• The stamen consists of a stalk called fi lament and two terminal lobes called
anther. 
• Anther is made up of microsporangia (pollen sacs) containing microspore mother
cells which produce microspores by meiosis. Microspores develop into pollen
grains within the anther.
• A pollen grain contains two nuclei, the tube nucleus and generative nucleus.
• Carpels are the megasporophylls. At the tip of the carpel is a sticky stigma that
receives pollens. The swollen base of the carpel forms the ovary. Ovary contains
one or more ovules A long, slender neck called style connects ovary with stigma.
• Ovule produces four megaspores by meiosis of which only one becomes
functional.
• Functional megaspore develops into the female gametophyte called the embryo
sac. It is a highly reduced microscopic structure.
• The mature embryo sac consists of eight nuclei contained within seven cellsthree antipodal cells, two polar nuclei in the central cell, two synergids and one
egg.
• Transfer of pollen grains to a mature stigma is known as pollination.
• In some plant species, pollen grains are transferred from an anther of a flower on
to the stigma of the same flower. This is self-pollination
• Pollen may be transferred to a stigma of a different flower. This is cross
pollination. 
• Most angiosperm plants are adapted for cross pollination.
• Typical characteristics of flowers like such as colour and odour. favour cross
pollination.
• In addition, some plants show special types of adaptations cross pollination.
e.g. heterostyly, self infertility, unisexuality
Signifi cance of cross pollination
Cross pollination results in cross fertilization. Cross fertilization allows shuffling
of genes within a species, producing new genetic combinations resulting increased
genetic variation within the species. These features are very important for survival and
also might lead to evolution.
Fertilization
• The pollen grain germinates after it is placed on the stigma.
• It extends a pollen tube that grows down through the style of the carpel.
• The generative nucleus divides forming two sperm nuclei.
• When the pollen tube reaches the ovary, it moves through the micropyle (The pore
in the integuments of the ovule) and discharges two sperm nuclei into the embryo
sac.
• One sperm nucleus fuses with the egg cell forming a diploid zygote and the other
sperm nucleus fuses with the 2 polar nuclei. This type of fertilization is called
double fertilization and is unique to angiosperms.
• After double fertilization, the ovule matures into a seed. The zygote develops into
the embryo. The triploid nucleus develops into the endosperm that store food.
• The significance of double fertilization is that it synchronizes with the development
of the embryo.
• If fertilization does not occur that prevents plants from wasting nutrients on infertile
ovules.
• The seed consists of the embryo, endosperm with store food and a seed coat.
• Seeds are enclosed in the fruit.
• Fruit is an enlarged and developed ovary, usually after being stimulated by
fertilization. Fertilization triggers hormonal changes that cause the ovary to form a
fruit.
• If a flower has not been pollinated, fruit does not develop, and entire flower falls
away.
• During fruit development, the ovary wall gets converted to the pericarp.
• In some plants fruits develop from the ovary without fertilization. This is called 
parthenocarpy. Parthenocarpic fruits do not develop seeds. Parthenocarpy
occurs naturally in some species.
e.g. Banana
• It also can be induced with plant growth substances to get seedless fruits.
e.g. Grapes, Orange
• In some plants, seeds develop without fertilization. This is called parthenogenesis.
e.g. certain grasses
• In parthenogenesis,
• the egg is resulted by mitosis and hence is diploid,or
• haploid ovum fuses with a polar nucleus, or
• the genetic content of the egg is duplicated to become diploid, enabling seed
development without fertilizing by the sperm. 

Signifi cance of development of seed and fruit
Seed
• Seed is the dispersal unit of seed plants which contains the embryo and stored
food, surrounded by the seed coat
• The seed habit has a strategy for life on land: The presence of,
• seed coat- helps to survive in extreme conditions
• food reserves-provide nourishment to the embryo during development
• dormancy period helps to survive during unfavorable conditions
• adaptations for dispersal give a better chance for growth , development and
survival.
Fruits
• Protects the enclosed seeds
• When mature, aids in their dispersal by wind , water or animals.
• After being dispersed, if environmental conditions are favourable, a seed may
germinate to form a seedling.
• Inhibition of embryo within the seed at one stage of maturation, naturally
prevents germination of seeds within fruit, which is called seed dormancy.
• Many seeds have mechanisms of inhibiting germination and remain dormant.
• Presence of inhibitors, presence of thick/strong seed coats, presence of seed
coats impervious to water are common causes of seed dormancy.
• After breaking seed dormancy, when water, oxygen and suitable temperature are
provided, seeds start to germinate.
• Absorption of water, activation of enzymes, mobilization of food resources 
(nutrients) followed by rapid growth process of the embryo extending radical
through the seed coat is called seed germination. Radical shows positive
geotropism and plumule shows negative geotropism. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
44,Evolution and Diversity of Organisms,Plant responses to internal and external Signals,"Responses of plants to different stimuli
Photomorphogenesis:
• Light triggers many key events in plant growth and development, collectively
known as photomorphogenesis.
• Light reception also allows plants to measure the passage of days and seasons.
• Plants detect not only light signals, but also the direction, intensity and wave
length (Color)
• A graph called an action spectrum depicts the relative effectiveness of
different wave lengths of radiation in carrying out a particular process, such as
photosynthesis.
• Action spectrum reveals that red and blue light are the most important colors in
regulating plant’s photomorphogenesis.
• The two major classes of light receptors in plants are the blue light photoreceptors
and phytochromes (which absorb mostly red light)
• Blue- Light photo receptors initiates a variety of responses in plants, including
phototropism, the light induced opening of stomata and the light induced slowing
of hypocotyl elongation that occurs when a seedling breaks ground.
• Phytochrome photoreceptors regulate many plant responses to light, including
seed germination and shade avoidance.
Effect of light on:
seed germination.
• As the nutrient reserves are limited, many types of seeds (especially small ones)
germinate only when the light environment and other conditions are nearly
optimal.
• Such seeds often remain dormant for years until light conditions change. (e.g.-
Plowing a fi eld or a death of a shady tree may create a favorable light environment
for germination)
plant spacing
• Phytochromes provide the plant with information about the quality of light which
enables the plant to get adapted to changes in outside light conditions.
e.g. “Shade Avoidance” response of a forest tree (below the canopy) that requires v relatively high light intensity. As the forest canopy absorbs more red light allowing
only far red light to pass through, the tree below the canopy will allocate more of
its resources to grow taller.
• In contrast, exposure to direct sunlight increases the proportion of far red: red
light and thereby stimulates branching and inhibits vertical growth.
flowering
• Photoperiod is the interval in a 24hour period in which the plant gets exposed to
light.
• Photoperiod controls flowering in many types of plants.
Shoot elongation and Phototropism
• The growth of a shoot towards light (positive) or away from it (negative) is
called phototropism.
• Positive phototropism strengthen photosynthesis.
• This response results from a differential growth of cells on opposite sides of the
shoot; the cells in the darker side elongate faster than the cells on the brighter
side.
Response to Gravity
Gravitropism
• Shoot of the plant grows upwards while root grows downwards, due to their
response to gravity or gravitropism.
• Gravitropism can be either positive or negative.
e.g. Roots display positive gravitropism while shoot display negative
gravitropism.
• Gravitropism occurs as soon as a seed germinates. This ensure that the root
grows into the soil and shoot grows towards sunlight.
• Plants may detect gravity by the settling of statoliths.
• Statoliths of vascular plants are specialized plastids containing dense starch
grains.
• They can settle under the gravity, to the lower portions of the cell.
• In roots, they are located in certain cells of the root cap.
The statolith hypothesis:
The aggregation of statoliths at the low points of root cap cells triggers re-distribution
of Ca2+ which causse lateral transport of auxin within the root. As a result, Ca and
auxin get accumulated at lower side of elongation zone of root. At high concentration
of auxin, cell elongation is inhibited resulting slow growth on lower side and more
rapid elongation on upper side. Consequently, the root grows downwards.
Response to mechanical stimuli
Trees grow in windy environment normally have shorter stockier trunks than same
species growing in normal environmental conditions. Advantage of this is that the tree
could stand high winds. This exhibits the sensitivity of mechanical stress of plants. the
changes in plant form due to mechanical disturbances is called thigmomorphogenesis.
During evolution, some plant species have become ‘touch specialists’. Climbing plants
have tendrils that coil rapidly around support. Tendril usually grows straight until it
touches a support. The contact stimulates differential growth on opposite sides of the
tendril. The directional growth of tendril towards support is called thigmotropism.
Other touch specialists, respond to touch by rapid leaf movements. E.g. Mimosa
pudica collapses its leaflets when touched. Touching results in a sudden loss of turgor
of cells in a specialized motor organ called pulvini, causing the leaflets to collapse.
This response is called thigmonasty","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
45,Evolution and Diversity of Organisms,"The role of plant growth substances/ hormones/ regulators in response
to different stimuli","Hormones in general are signaling molecules which are produced in small quantities,
get transported from the place they are produced to other parts of the organism and
trigger responses in target cells. or/and effect on plant growth and development. With
this definition, its hard to explain some physiological processes in plants. In addition,
some signaling molecules that are considered as plant hormones act locally. Thus the
broader term plant growth regulators seem more appropriate.
Plant growth regulators are natural or synthetic organic compounds which modify or
control specific physiological process in plants.
Plant biologists prefer to use the term plant growth regulators rather than plant
hormones, as there are certain differences in plant hormones and animal hormones.
Therefore, plant hormones and plant growth substances are considered as equal. But
plant hormones are active even at very low concentration.
Major types of plant hormones/ growth regulators are auxins, gibberlin, cytokinin,
abscisic acid, ethylene and Jasmonate (jasmonic acid). 

Plant hormones play key roles in regulating growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli.
Auxin is crucial for several processes, including stimulating stem elongation at low concentrations, promoting the formation of lateral and adventitious roots, regulating fruit development, enhancing apical dominance, and contributing to both phototropism and gravitropism. It also promotes vascular differentiation and delays leaf abscission.
Gibberellins primarily stimulate stem elongation, pollen development, and pollen tube growth. They are also involved in fruit growth, seed development, and germination, while regulating sex determination and the transition from juvenile to adult phases in plants.
Cytokinins regulate cell division in shoots and roots, modify apical dominance by promoting lateral bud growth, facilitate nutrient movement into sink tissues, stimulate seed germination, and delay leaf senescence.
Abscisic acid (ABA) acts as a growth inhibitor and plays a significant role in promoting stomatal closure during drought stress. It promotes seed dormancy, inhibits early germination, promotes leaf senescence, and enhances desiccation tolerance.
Ethylene is well-known for promoting the ripening of fruit, as well as promoting leaf abscission and inducing the triple response in seedlings, which includes inhibition of stem elongation, lateral expansion, and horizontal growth. Ethylene also enhances senescence, promotes root and root hair formation, and induces flowering in the pineapple family.

Response of plants to some biotic and abiotic stresses
Stress
Certain factors in the environment may have a potentially adverse effects on a plants’
survival, growth and reproduction.
Two types of stresses,
1. Abiotic stress
2. Biotic stress
Response of plants to some biotic and abiotic stresses
Stress
Certain factors in the environment may have potentially adverse effects on plants’
survival, growth and reproduction.
Two types of stresses;
3. Abiotic stress(due to nonliving factors)
4. Biotic stress (due to living factors)
Abiotic Stress
Among several common abiotic stresses. Following three stresses are discussed.
1. Drought stress
2. Cold stress
3. Salt stress
1. Drought stress: Plants may wilt when water loss by transpiration exceeds water
absorption. Prolonged drought may even kill a plant. Plants have control systems that
enable them to cope with the drought/ water defi cit conditions.
Water deficit stimulates increased synthesis and release of abscisic acid (ABA), which
acts on guard cell membrane, closing stomata to reduce transpiration.
In grasses the leaves roll in to a tube-like shape which reduces the surface area to
reduce transpiration. Some plants shed their leaves during seasonal drought.
2.Cold stress: When cell membrane cools below a critical temperature it looses its
fluidity due to the lipids become locked in to crystalline structure. This blocks the
transport across the membrane and affects the function of the cell.
Plants respond to cold stress by altering the lipid composition of their membranes.
They increase the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids which keeps the membranes
more fluid at low temperature.
Freezing is another cold stress. Water in the cell wall and intercellular spaces freezes
before freezing the solute-rich water in the cytosol. The reduction of liquid water in the
cell wall lowers the extracellular water potential causing water in the cytosol to leave. 
This results high concentration of solutes in the cytoplasm which is harmful and may
lead to cell death.
Before the onset of winter, the cell of frost-tolerant plants increases cytoplasmic levels
of specific solutes such as sugars that help to reduce the loss of water from the cell
preventing dehydration.
3. Salt stress: An excess of salts (high salinity) in soil lowers the water potential of soil
resulting reduced water potential gradient from soil to root. This leads to reduction of
water uptake by roots.
In general too high salinity in soil is toxic to plants.
Many plants can respond to moderate soil salinity by producing solutes that are well
tolerated at high concentrations. These are organic compounds that keep the water
potential of cell more negative than that of the soil solution.
A few plants that are salt-tolerant (halophytes) have developed salt glands, which
secrete excess salts out of the plant across leaf surfaces. e.g. many mangrove plants
Biotic stress –
How plants defend themselves against pest and pathogens attack;
In plant defense mechanisms, some compounds and structures are already existed
whilst some others are formed after infection or pest attack. Therefore, two categories
of defense mechanisms called preexisting and induced mechanisms can be identified.
Preexisting structural and chemical defense mechanisms;
- Amount and quality of wax and cuticle that cover the epidermal cells
- The structure of the epidermal cell walls and thickness
- The size, location and shapes of stomata
- Toxic compounds, alkaloids (eg. Nicotine), phenolics (eg. Flavonoids,
lignin & tannins), terpenoids (eg. Azadirachtin) and lectin
- Thorns, pricks, trichromes
Induced structural and chemical defense mechanisms;
- Morphological changes in the cell wall
- Formation of cork and abscission layers
- Phenolic compounds
- Toxic compounds
- Enzymes that can degrade fungal cell walls or damage insect organs ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
46,Animal Form and Function,Relate the Structure of Animal Tissues to their function,"There are four major types of animal tissues : Epithelial tissue, Connective tissue, Muscle tissue and Nervous tissue.
1. Epithelial tissue: -
Characteristics
It covers external or internal free surfaces and organs. The cells of the tissues are
closely packed. Cells of epithelial tissue have both apical and basal surfaces where
apical surface remains free and the basal surface attached to the basement membrane.
No blood vessels in the tissue. Tissue gets nutrients and oxygen from the underneath
connective tissue.
Functions-
• Protection (e.g. barrier against mechanical injury, pathogens, barrier against
fluid loss
• Secretion (e.g. enzymes, hormones, mucus, sweat)
• Absorption (e.g. nutrients, respiratory gases )
There are two general types according to the number of cell layers on the basement
membrane.
• Simple epithelia – Single cell layer (e.g simple squamous, simple cuboidal,
simple columnar and pseudostratified)
• Compound epithelia – several cell layers (e.g. stratified squamous, transitional)
Simple squamous epithelium –
It is a single layer with plate like cells. This type of epithelium is thin and leaky. They
are found in places where materials exchange by diffusion.
e.g: blood capillaries, alveoli, 

Simple cuboidal epithelium –
It is a single cell layer with dice shaped cells specialized for secretion. It is found in
kidney tubules, many glands such as thyroid glands and salivary glands 

Simple columnar epithelium
It is a single layer with large and brick-shaped cells. It is often found in places where
secretion or active absorption is important. e.g. intestinal lining 

Pseudostratified columnar epithelium
This tissue consists of a single cell layer. Cells are not of equal height. Nuclei of
cells are located at different level. Appear as several layers. In many vertebrates this
epithelium has ciliated cells that form a mucous membrane and the cilia help to sweep
the mucous along the surface. e.g. nasal passage, trachea. 

Compound epithelia –
Stratified squamous epithelium:
This tissue is composed of a number of layers of cells. This epithelium regenerates
rapidly. Cell division produces new cells near the basement membrane. The old cells
are sloughed off and replaced by the new cells . This epithelium is found on surfaces
where they are subjected to abrasion such as outer skin, lining of mouth, anus, vagina ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
47,Animal Form and Function,Connective tissue,"Characteristics
Connective tissues are the most abundant tissues in the body that help to connect
organs and tissues together structurally and functionally. These types of tissue
consist of different types of cells scattered in a large amount of extracellular matrix
containing different types of fibers. Matrix may be a semisolid (Jelly-like), liquid or 

solid (dense and rigid). Different types of cells can be found in the matrix such as
fibroblasts (secrete fiber proteins), macrophages (engulf foreign particles or any cell
debris by phagocytosis) and mast cells ( secrete heparin and histamine) in addition fat
cells (storage and insulation) and leukocytes (protection) are found in some connective
tissues.
There are three different types of fibers. They are collagen fibers (provide strength
and flexibility), reticular fibers (join connective tissues to adjacent tissues) and elastic
fibers (make tissue elastic).
Functions
• Binding and structural support
• Protection
• Transport of materials
• Insulation
There are different types of connective tissues. They are loose connective tissue
(Areolar tissue), Fibrous connective tissue (Dense connective tissue), adipose tissue,
blood, cartilage and bone .
Loose connective tissue (Areolar Tissue)
This tissue is the most widely distributed connective tissue type in the vertebrate body.
This can be considered as the generalized type of connective tissue. Types of cells in
this tissue are fibroblasts, macrophages, mast cells, leukocytes and fat cells.
All three types of fibres are found in this tissue. Fibers are loosely arranged and wavy
in nature. This tissue binds epithelia and the underlying tissue. Therefore this holds
organs in place. This tissue is found under the skin and throughout the body.
Fibrous connective tissue (Dense connective tissue)
This tissue is densely packed with collagen fibers. Therefore the matrix is relatively
reduced and contains fewer cells (fibrocytes). This tissue is found in tendons (attach
muscle to bones) and ligaments (connect bones and joints) where tensile strength is
required.
Adipose tissue
This tissue is packed with adipose cells. Each adipose cell contains a large fat droplet.
This is a specialized type of loose connective tissue which pads and insulates the body
and stores fuel as fat molecules. For instance, it is found under the skin where it act as
a thermal insulator and energy store. 

Blood tissue
It is a specialized connective tissue where the matrix is not secreted by the cells and fibers
are formed only during blood clotting process. The extracellular matrix of the blood
is liquid. It is called as plasma. The blood plasma contains salts, water and dissolved
proteins. Red blood cells (transport respiratory gases), white blood cells (defense) and
platelets (blood clotting) are suspended in the blood plasma. Main functions of blood
tissues include transport of materials, protection, and osmoregulation. (For further
details refer pg 195)
Cartilage
This tissue consists of a matrix composed of chondroitin sulphate which is a rubbery
protein-carbohydrate complex. Collagen fibers and chondrocytes are embedded in
the matrix. Chondrocytes secrete chondroitin sulphate and collagen fibers. This tissue
provides support and flexibility in places such as trachea, intervertebral discs.
Bone
It is a mineralized connective tissue. Matrix consists of collagen fibres and inorganic
salts. Inorganic salts are Calcium, magnesium and phosphate ions. Cells are osteoblasts
(bone forming cells) and osteocytes (mature bone cells that maintain bone tissue).
Osteocytes are enclosed within lacunae. The mammalian hard bone has repeating units
called osteons. Each osteons has a concentric layer of mineralized materials. At the
centre of the osteon is a central canal containing blood vessels and nerves. This tissue
forms the endoskeleton of most vertebrates and provides support and strength to the
body","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
48,Animal Form and Function,Muscle tissue,"Muscle tissue is responsible for movement. The cells in the muscle tissue are composed
of actin and myosin proteins. This tissue is able to contract and relax. There are three
basic types of muscle tissues found in the vertebrate animal body. They are smooth
muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle tissues.
Smooth muscle tissue
The cells of the smooth muscle tissue are spindle shaped and uninucleated. Cells lack
striations. This tissue is responsible for involuntary body functions (e.g. churning
of stomach, constriction of arteries). This tissue is found in digestive tract, urinary
bladder, arteries and other internal organs. 

Skeletal muscle tissue
They are composed of bundles of long cells with multi nuclei. Cells are striated. The
contractile units of this muscle cells are called sarcomers. This gives the striated
appearance to the muscle cells. The arrangement of the sarcomere gives the striated
appearance. The muscles are generally attached to the skeletal system and helps mainly
in voluntary body movements.
Cardiac muscle tissue
They are composed of uninucleated cells which are interconnected via intercalated
discs. Cells are striated with sarcomeres. Cardiac muscle tissue is responsible for
involuntary heart contractions. Intercalated disks help relay signals from cell to cell
and synchronize heart contraction. Cardiac muscle tissue is only found in the wall of
the heart. 

4. Nervous tissue
Nervous tissue contains neurons and glial cells. Neurons receive, process and transmit
nerve impulses. Neuroglia (Glial cells) support the neurons.
Neurons: A neuron has cell body, dendrites and axon. The basic structural unit of
the nervous system is the neuron. Dendrites and cell body is used to receive nerve
impulses from other neurons. Axon is used to transmit impulses to other neurons, cells
or muscles. Axons are bundled together into nerves. 
Neuroglia (Glial cells): Neuroglial cells are supportive cells of neurons. Their functions
include nourishment of nerve cells, insulation of nerve cells, replenishing neurons and
sometimes modulate neuron functions. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
49,Animal Form and Function,Nutrition in animals,"Animal nutrition is the process by which food is taken in for make use in different
body functions. Typically food is broken into smaller molecules and absorbed prior to
utilization. Animals are heterotrophs.
Heterptrophic nutrition is the process by which the organisms obtain organic food
molecules by ingesting other organisms or by substances derived from other organisms.
Other than animals, fungi and majority of bacteria are heterotrophs. There are two
type of heterotrophic nutrition namely, holozoic nutrition and symbiosis.
Holozoic nutrition
Most animals are holozoic where they ingest food into their alimentary canal. This
mode of nutrition consists of five main stages: Ingestion, digestion, absorption,
assimilation and elimination/ Egestion.
Main stages in holozoic nutrition
• Ingestion: This is the first stage where the act of eating or feeding happens.
Food sources differ among animal species and they possess different modes of
ingestion according to the diet or environment.
• Digestion: Food is broken down into molecules small enough to pass through
the membranes and enter the cells of organisms. Digestion could occur
mechanically (by teeth or muscle contractions) and chemically (by enzymes).
During mechanical digestion, food is broken down in to smaller fragments
thus increase the surface area for efficient chemical digestion. During chemical
digestion enzymes break bonds in large molecules into small molecules.
The last two stages of food processing occur after the food is digested.
• Absorption: In this stage, the animal’s cells take up small molecules. e.g.simple
sugars, amino acids
• Assimilation: Assimilation is the process of utilization of absorbed nutrients for
various functions of the body.
• Elimination: In this process undigested materials are passed out from the
alimentary canal.
Feeding Mechanisms of animals
• Filter feeders: They strain suspended food particles from the surrounding
watery medium. They use several mechanisms such as capturing, trapping, etc.
e.g. - clams and oysters - feed on small pieces of food in the water that passes
over their gills. Cilia in the gills sweep the food particles to the animal’s mouth
in a film of mucus. 

• Fluid feeders: They suck nutrient rich fluid from a living host using well adapted
mouth parts.
e.g: Mosquitoes-suck human blood, Aphids- suck phloem sap of plants, Bees
and humming birds suck -honey from flowers
• Substrate feeders: These animals live inside their food source or on the food
source eating its way through the food.
e.g. The leaf miner caterpillar - eating through the soft tissues of a leaf
Maggots (fly larvae) - burrow into animal carcasses
• Bulk feeders: Animals which eat comparatively large pieces of food. These
animals have different types of adaptations to tear the food or to capture the pray
(e.g. jaws, teeth, tentacles, claws, poisonous fangs ).
e.g. - Most animals including human
• Symbiosis
This is an ecological relationship between organisms of two different species
that live closely together. It is divided into three groups such as Mutualism,
Parasitism and Commensalism
• Mutualism: It is a close association between two living organisms of different
species which benefits both partners.
e. g. - Cellulose digesting microorganisms in Ruminants and Termites
• Parasitism: It is a close association between two living organisms of different
species which is beneficial to one (parasite) and harmful to the other (host).
Parasites live either within or on the host and derive its nourishment
e.g. –Tape worm and humans, Lice and humans
• Commensalism: It is a close association between two living organisms of
different species which is beneficial to one and does not affect the other (neither
harmful or beneficial)
e.g.- Barnacles attached to whales ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
50,Animal Form and Function,Human Digestive system,"Structure and function of the human digestive system
Human alimentary canal is a long tube/ tract which connects with external environment
and can fulfill steps of holozoic mode of nutrition. Human digestive system consists of
alimentary canal and associated glands. The alimentary canal consists of the following
parts: oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum
and anus. The associated glands include salivary glands, pancreas and liver. 

Mouth/ Oral cavity: Oral cavity consists of the tongue, teeth and salivary glands.
Ingestion and initial steps of digestion are carried out in the oral cavity. In the mouth
both mechanical and chemical digestion is carried out. There are four types of teeth in
the mouth: incisors, canines, premolars and molars. Food is cut, mashed and ground
by different types of teeth with different shapes. This makes it easier to swallow food
and increase the surface area for digestion.
Salivary glands release saliva into the oral cavity through ducts. Releasing saliva into
the oral cavity occurs when food enters the oral cavity due to a nervous reflex. Saliva
is also released into the mouth before food is ingested due to various other stimuli. e.g.
sight, odor of food, etc.
Saliva contains water, amylase, mucus (a viscous mixture of salts, cells and slippery
glycoprotein called mucins). In addition to that, saliva composed of buffers and anti
microbial components.
Functions of the saliva
• Salivary amylase: Chemical digestion of polysaccharides (e.g. starch) into
smaller polysaccharides and disaccharide maltose.
• Water: Liquefy food and provide watery medium for chemical digestion. Aids in
taste reception.
• Mucus: Lubrication of food which makes it easier for swallowing. Clean the
mouth and protects the lining of the mouth from abrasion.
• Antimicrobial substances such as immunoglobulin and lysozymes: Protect
against bacteria that enter the mouth.
• Buffers prevent tooth decay by neutralizing acid
Tongue: composed of skeletal muscles. Helps to mix the food with saliva and make
bolus of food that makes easier for swallowing. Then helps to push the bolus into the
posterior part of the oral cavity and into the pharynx.
Pharynx: a common passage of the respiratory tract and the digestive tract. The
pharynx leads to the esophagus.
Esophagus:
It is a long tube which connects the pharynx and the stomach. It is found in the thoracic
cavity. The wall of the esophagus consists of both skeletal and smooth muscles. The
skeletal muscles are located towards the uppermost part of the esophagus and these
muscles function during swallowing. The rest of the esophagus consists of smooth
muscles which are involved in the process called peristalsis. During this process the
food bolus is pushed along the esophagus which is a alternative wave of rhythmic
contractions and relaxations of the smooth muscles lining the esophagus. 

Stomach- The stomach is a J- shaped dilated sac in the abdominal cavity. The inner
surface of the stomach is highly folded and contains large number of pits that leads
to gastric glands. Gastric glands contain three types of cells: mucus cells, chief cells
and parietal cells. The stomach wall is very elastic. Distal part of the stomach connects
with the small intestine. Sphincters are found at the junctions between esophagus and
stomach (cardiac sphincter) and stomach and the small intestine(pyloric sphincter).
They are made up of circular smooth muscles. These sphincters help to regulate the
passage of materials between these organs.
Chemical digestion in the stomach
The gastric glands of the stomach secrete gastric juice. The gastric juice mainly consists
of mucus, pepsinogen and HCl. Mucus and pepsinogen (inactive form of pepsin )
are secreted by mucous cells and chief cells respectively. The parietal cells release
hydrogen ions and chloride ions separately into the stomach lumen where HCl is
formed. Pepsinogen is initially converted into pepsin by HCl. These activated pepsin
help to activate remaining pepsinogen molecules. This activated pepsin initiates the
chemical digestion of proteins in the stomach. The churning action of the stomach
facilitates the chemical digestion. This is a series of muscle contraction and relaxation.
This process mixes the swallowed food with gastric juice. Proteins are hydrolyzed to
small polypeptides by pepsin. In the stomach food is mixed with gastric juice forming
chyme (partially digested semisolid, acidic, food mass).
The stomach lining is protected from the digestion of HCl and pepsin in several ways:
Enzymes are secreted in to the lumen as an inactive enzyme; Gastric glands secrete
mucus that protect against self-digestion of the stomach lining ; Every three days, cell
division adds a new epithelial cell layer which replaces the destroyed/ damaged cells
in the lining of the stomach.
Functions of the stomach
• Act as a temporary reservoir for food due to high convolution and very elastic
wall.
• Mechanical digestion of food by churning action due to muscular contraction.
• Produce gastric juice which starts the chemical digestion of proteins to
polypeptide by pepsin
• Absorption of some materials such as water, alcohol and some drugs
• Non specific defense-HCl kills microbes
• Small jets of gastric contents push out through pyloric sphincter as chyme
• Secretion of gastrin hormone which regulates digestion in the stomach. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
51,Animal Form and Function,Small intestine,"It is the longest organ in the alimentary canal. It is divided into three regions: duodenum,
jejunum and ileum. The duodenum: C shaped curve, around the head of the pancreas.
The jejunum is middle part of the small intestine. The ileum is the terminal part
of the small intestine. The surface area of the small intestine is greatly increased by
permanent circular folds and villi. The villi are tiny finger like projections of the
intestinal wall. Most of the digestion is completed in the duodenum. The major sites
for nutrient absorption are jejunum and ileum. 

Chemical digestion in the small intestine
Small intestine receives chyme from the stomach. Peristaltic contractions aid the
receiving of this chyme. Pyloric sphincter regulate the passing of chyme into the
small intestine. The chyme is mixed with secretions of glands in intestinal wall and
secretions of pancreas and liver. (refer pages no: 169,170). The epithelium of the
duodenum secretes several digestive enzymes. Glands of the intestinal wall secrete
enzymes such as Disaccharidases, Dipeptidases, Carboxypeptidases, Aminopeptidases,
Nucleotidases, Nucleosidases and Phosphotases. Some of these enzymes are secreted
to the lumen and others are bound to the surface of the epithelium.
Two hormones namely cholecystokonin and secretin secreted by duodenum stimulates
the release of pancreatic juice and the bile. Pancreatic juice contains enzymes such as
Trypsin, Chymotrypsin , Pancreatic amylase , Pancreatic Carboxypeptidases, Pancreatic
Nucleases and Pancreatic Lipases. In addition it also contains bicarbonates. The liver
secretes Bile which is stored in the gall bladder until released into the duodenum. 

Carbohydarte digestion
Pancreatic amylase catalyze the conversion of polysaccharides (e.g. starch) into
disaccharides. Intestinal disaccharidases catalyze the conversion of disaccharides into
monosaccharides.
Protein digestion
Tripsin and Chymotripsin catalyse the conversion of small polypeptides into smaller
polypeptides. These smaller polypeptides are converted to small peptides and amino
acids by the catalytic action of Panceratic carboxypeptidases. Proteases secreted by
the intestinal epithelium (Dipeptidases, Carboxypeptidases and Aminopeptidases)
catalyse the conversion of small peptides into amino acids.
Fat digestion
Digestion of fats (triglycerides) starts in the small intestine. First bile salts emulsify
fats. Next Pancreatic lipase catalyse the conversion of these fats into fatty acids,
glycerol and monoglycerides.

Protein digestion
Tripsin and Chymotripsin catalyse the conversion of small polypeptides into smaller
polypeptides. These smaller polypeptides are converted to small peptides and amino
acids by the catalytic action of Panceratic carboxypeptidases. Proteases secreted by
the intestinal epithelium (Dipeptidases, Carboxypeptidases and Aminopeptidases)
catalyse the conversion of small peptides into amino acids. 

Fat digestion
Digestion of fats (triglycerides) starts in the small intestine. First bile salts emulsify
fats. Next Pancreatic lipase catalyse the conversion of these fats into fatty acids,
glycerol and monoglycerides. 

Nucleic acid digestion
Digestion of nucleic acids start in the small intestine. Pancreatic nucleases catalyse
the conversion of DNA and RNA into nucleotides. These nucleotides are eventually
converted into nitrogenous bases, sugars and phosphates by the catalytic action of
intestinal Nucleotidases, Nucleosidases and Phosphatases. 

Absorption in the small intestine
• For effective absorption, the surface area of the intestinal wall has been
increased with three structural modifications: heavy permanent foldings, finger
like projections called villi in the intestinal wall and finger like microscopic
projections called microvilli in the epithelial cells of the villi. These micro villi
are exposed into the intestinal lumen, it gives the appearance of brush (brush
border).
• Transport of the nutrients across the epithelium may be active or passive. For
example Fructose is absorbed by facilitated diffusion. Amino acids, small
peptides, vitamins, and most glucose molecules are actively transported into the
epithelial cells.
• Then these nutrients from the epithelial cells are transported into the blood
capillaries in the villi. Those blood capillaries are converged into the hepatic
portal veins. These nutrients are carried in to the liver via the hepatic portal
veins. From the liver, this nutrient filled blood is transported into the tissues.
• But absorption of some products of fat digestion takes place in a different
pathway: Fatty acids and monoglycerides are absorbed into the cell through
microvilli. Within the cells triglycerides are reformed and they are incooperated
into water soluble globules called chylomicrons. These chylomicrons are
transported into the lacteal and then into the blood vessels through lymph. Then
they are transported throughout the body via the circulatory system. 
• In addition to nutrient absorption, recovery of water and ions mostly occur in the
small intestine. In addition to the water intake (about 2 L) digestive juices add
more water (about 7 L) into the small intestine. Most of this water is reabsorbed
via osmosis. 

Large intestine – The large intestine is the terminal end of the alimentary canal. It
is divided into three regions: colon (proximal part), cecum and rectum. The small
intestine is connected to the large intestine at a ‘T’ shaped junction. One arm of the
‘T’ junction is colon and the other arm is a small pouch called cecum. A finger like
projection in the cecum is called the appendix. The colon leads to the rectum and anus.
Cecum is important for fermentation of indigested materials by microbes, especially
in animals that eat large amount of plant matter.
Functions of the large intestine
• The colon: completes the reabsorption of water, synthesize some Vitamin B
complexes, Vitamin K and folic acid with the help of microbes and move feces
(consists of undigested matter such as fibres) along the colon by peristalsis.
• The rectum stores feces until they are eliminated. Presence of two sphincters
between the rectum and anus can regulate feces movement. Strong contractions
in the colon trigger the defecation. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
52,Animal Form and Function,Associated glands,"Pancreas 

Histological structure of pancreas
The pancreas is a pale grey gland which consists of a broad head, a body and a narrow
tail. Head is in the curve of the duodenum. Pancreas is both an exocrine and endocrine
gland.
The exocrine part consists of a large number of lobules made up of small acini, the
walls of which consist of secretary cells. Each lobule is drained by a tiny duct and
these unite eventually to form the pancreatic duct which joins with bile duct to form
hepato pancreatic duct and opens into the duodenum at its midpoint. Exocrine part
of the pancreas secretes pancreatic juice. The components of the pancreatic juice
are bicarbonate, carbohydrate digesting enzymes (pancreatic amylase), pancreatic
lipase, nucleases and inactive form of protein digesting enzymes(trpsinogen and
chymotrypsinogen). These inactive enzymes are converted to active enzymes(trypsin
and chymotrypsin) upon secretion into the lumen of the duodenum.
Endocrine part of the pancreas is the islets of Langerhans, which consist of group
of specialized cells. They do not have ducts. Islets of Langerhans secrete hormones,
glucagan and insulin which are involved in glucose homeostasis. 

Liver
Liver is the largest gland in the body. Its upper and anterior surfaces are smooth and
convex. Its posterior surface is irregular in outline. Liver contains four lobes. Each
lobe is made up of tiny hexagonal shape lobules which are the functional unit. These
lobules are made up of cuboidal cells called hepatocytes which are arranged in pairs of
columns radiating from a central vein. Between two pairs of column of cells there are
sinusoids (blood vessels with incomplete walls) containing mixture of blood from the
tiny branches of the portal vein and hepatic artery. This arrangement allows venous
blood (high concentration of nutritional materials) to mix with arterial blood and come
into close contact with liver cells. Hepatic macrophages (Kupffer cells) are found in
the lining of the sinusoids. Blood drains from the sinusoids into central veins which
joins with veins from the other lobules, forming larger veins and eventually the hepatic
vein. (fi g 5.12). Bile canaliculi run between columns of liver cells. Canaliculi join up
to form larger bile canals. In the corner of the hexagonal structure a branch of hepatic
artery, a branch of the hepatic portal vein and intra lobular bile duct can be found.
Liver is a vital organ that performs many important functions. In addition to its role in
food digestion it is also perform functions such as metabolism of carbohydrates, fats
and proteins, detoxification of drugs and toxic substances, defense against microbes,
some hormone inactivation and heat production. 

Function of liver related to digestion
The liver secretes bile which is stored in the gall bladder until released into the
duodenum. The bile contains bile salts which act as emulsifiers that help in fat digestion
and absorption.
Most of the absorbed nutrients reach the liver and it regulates the distribution of
nutrients to the rest of the body. Excess glucose is stored as glycogen in the liver
cells. Glycogen deposition and break down in the liver cells are regulated by insulin
and glucagon hormones. Fat soluble Vitamins (A,D,E and K) and some water soluble
vitamins (B12), iron and copper are also stored in liver.
Regulation of digestion in man
Digestion in man is regulated by two ways: nervous regulation and endocrine
regulation. Nervous regulation is mainly by nervous reflexes. For example nervous
reflex stimulates the release of saliva when food reach the mouth. Arrival of food in
the stomach trigger churning and release of gastric juices. Endocrine system plays a
critical role in digestion especially in the stomach and small intestine.
when food arrives the stomach, the stomach wall is stretched. This triggers to release
the hormone gastrin. Gastrin circulates via the blood stream and arrives the stomach.
Then gastrin stimulates the production of gastric juice at the stomach.
Fatty acids and amino acids in the chyme trigger the release of Cholecystokinin and
Secretin from the duodenum. Cholecystokinin triggers release of bile from the gall
bladder and digestive enzymes from the pancreas. Secretin stimulates the release of
bicarbonate from the pancreas. Bicarbonate neutralize the chyme received from the
stomach
When the chyme is rich in fat, food digestion in the stomach slows down due to high
levels of Cholecystokinin and Secretin secreted by duodenum. These hormones act on
the stomach and inhibit peristalsis and gastric juice secretion.","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
53,Animal Form and Function,Balanced Diet,"The balanced diet contains the all essential nutrients required for health in the appropriate
proportions. Essential components of the balanced diet contain carbohydrates, proteins,
lipids, fibers, minerals, vitamins and water. Carbohydrates and lipids supply energy.
Energy requirements vary with age, sex, body size and activity. Twenty amino acids are
needed to synthesize proteins in the body. Most of these amino acids are synthesized
within the body. They are known as non essential amino acids (e.g. Alanine, cystine,
etc). Other amino acids (e.g. lysine and histidine, etc.) must be obtained from the diet
as they can’t be synthesized within the body. They are called essential amino acids.
Animal proteins contain all the essential amino acids in proper proportions. However
most plant proteins lack one or more essential amino acids. Therefore vegetarian based
diet requires several sources of plant proteins to obtain all the essential amino acids. 

Components of foods and their functions
• Carbohydrates
• Proteins
• Lipids
• Vitamins
• Mineral elements
• water
• fibers
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are sugars and polysaccharides. They can be found in a variety of foods
such as rice, bread, biscuits, cereals, hoppers, etc. during digestion most carbohydrates
are broken down into monosaccharides which are absorbed into blood stream.
Functions of digestible carbohydrates
• Provide energy and heat: breakdown of carbohydrates provides ATP for body
functions and generates heat.
• Act as an energy stores. e.g. excess carbohydrates are converted into glycogen
and fat
• Facilitates protein sparing- proteins are not used to get energy when there is an
adequate carbohydrates in the food
Proteins
Proteins are made up of amino acids during the digestion, proteins are broken down
into amino acids and absorbed into the blood stream.
The amino acids are grouped into two groups i.e. essential amino acids and non
essential amino acids. These essential amino acids cannot be synthesized in the body,
therefore they should be obtained into the body through the diet. The non essential
amino acids can be synthesized within the body. Therefore it is not necessary to obtain
them through the diet.
Functions of proteins in the diet
• The amino acids which are supplied from proteins
• are used for growth and repair of body cells and tissues
• are used for synthesis of plasma proteins, enzymes, antibodies and some
hormones
• Act as an energy source for body functions 

Lipids
Lipids in the diet are mainly composed of fats and oils. Fatty acids are composed of
fats and oils. Fatty acids can be grouped as essential and non essential fatty acids.
Essential fatty acids cannot be synthesized within the body while the non essential
fatty acids can be synthesized within the body. Therefore essential fatty acids should
be obtained through the food.
Functions of lipids in the diet
• Provide energy and heat (on weight basis fats and oils provide more energy
compared to carbohydrates and proteins)
• Help in transport and storage of fat soluble vitamins such as Vitamin A, D, E and
K
• Store energy as fat in the adipose tissues
• Help to synthesize steroid hormones from cholesterol.
• Provide insulation: (e.g fat found in subcutaneous layer in the skin reduces heat
loss , constituents of myelin sheath of neurons)
Vitamins
Vitamins are organic compounds required in small amounts for the maintenance of
normal health and metabolism. Vitamins cannot be produced in the body and therefore
should be provided in the diet. If the vitamins are insufficiently taken into the body,
that may lead to the deficiency diseases. Vitamins are two types they are fat soluble
vitamins (Vitamin A, D, E and K) and water soluble vitamins (Vitamin B and C).
Main Functions of Vitamins
• Vitamin A- form visual pigments in the eye, epithelial tissue maintenance,
promotion of growth and immunity
• Vitamin B- components of coenzymes such as FAD and NAD, promote red
blood cell production
• Vitamin C- act as an antioxidant, used in collagen synthesis
• Vitamin D- aids in absorption and use of Calcium and Phosphorous
• Vitamin E- act as an antioxidant
• Vitamin K- important in blood clotting
Minerals
Minerals are inorganic substances and they are also important for normal health and
many body functions. Major mineral elements needed by humans are Ca, P, S, K, Cl,
Na, Mg, Fe, F and I . In addition minerals needed in trace amounts include Co, Cu,
Mn, Mo, Se and Zn. 

Main functions of minerals include
• Ca- form bones and teeth, helps clotting blood and nerve and muscle function
• P- form bones and teeth, help maintain in acid base balance
• S- components of some amino acids
• K- help maintain in acid base balance and water balance, nerve function
• Cl- help maintain in acid base balance, maintain osmotic balance, nerve function
• Na- help maintain in acid base balance and water balance, nerve function
• Mg- act as enzyme cofactor
• Fe- components of hemoglobin and electron carriers, act as an enzyme cofactor
• F- maintenance of tooth structure
• I- component of thyroid hormone
Water
Water accounts for around 60% of the body mass in humans. Normally water is lost
through urine, sweating and feces. Therefore amount of water in the body should be
balanced within the body. This water can be taken in to the body by drinking and via
foods.
Functions of water in human body
• Provides the moist internal environment for all living cells.
• Major component of blood and tissue fluid therefore helps to transport materials
around the body and to exchange materials between blood and tissues and body
cells
• Regulate body temperature mainly through evaporative cooling
• Dilute waste products and toxins and provide a medium for their excretion
• Moisten the food and that make easier to swallow
Fibres
Dietary fibres (non starch polysaccharides) are made up of indigestible polysaccharides
in the diet. Fibres are rich in fruit, vegetable and cereals.
Functions of dietary fibres
• Provide bulk to the diet and satisfy the appetite.
• Prevent constipation by attracting water to increase faecal bulk and stimulating
peristalsis leading to defecation.
• Adequate fibres in the diet protect against some gastro-intestinal disorders such
as cancers in the colon and rectum.","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
54,Animal Form and Function,Essential nutrients," Essential nutrients are the substances that cannot be synthesized
in the body from simple precursors and must therefore be taken through the diet.
These essential nutrients include essential amino acids, essential fatty acids, vitamins
and minerals. Essential nutrients have key functions in bio synthetic reaction in the
body cells. If these essential nutrients are not supplied in correct proportions in the
diet that will lead to malnutrition. Therefore it is essential to obtain them in correct
amounts.
Essential amino acids: Essential amino acids are the amino acids that must be
obtained from the food since they cannot be synthesized within the body from organic
precursor molecules. Of the 20 amino acids required to make proteins in the body 8
amino acids are essential amino acids. Examples for essential amino acids are leucine
and methionine. The animal protein products (e.g. eggs, meat, cheese, etc.) will
provide all essential amino acids in correct proportions required for body functions.
Most plant proteins are “incomplete” as they are deficient in one or more amino acids.
Therefore vegetarian diet should contain a variety of plant proteins in order to obtain
all the essential amino acids required.
Essential fatty acids: Essential fatty acids are the fatty acids that should be obtained
from the diet since they cannot be synthesized in the body from organic precursors.
Seeds, grains and vegetables provide enough amounts of essential fatty acids.

Basal metabolic rate (BMR)
• Basal metabolic rate is defined as the minimum metabolic rate at rest, when in a
post absorptive stage (at least 12 hour fasting) and is not experiencing stress.
• BMR is measured under a “comfortable” temperature range.
• BMR of humans averages for adult males 1,600-1,800 kcal per day and 1,300-
1,500 kcal for adult females.
Energy budget: An energy budget is a balance sheet of energy intake against energy
expenditure in a particular animal. The basic model of energy budget can be shown as
follows;
C=M+U+F+P 

Where C=Energy content in the food sources taken in
M= Energy spent for metabolic activities
U= Energy associated with urinary loss
F= Energy associated with fecal loss
P= Production (Energy available for growth and reproduction)
In energy budgets, energy content in the food intake is compared with energy
expenditure which includes energy spent for basal metabolism and extra activities
(M), energy associated with excretory products namely urinary loss (U) and fecal loss
(F). The energy differences between the energy intake and the energy expenditure
for metabolism and excretion are available for production which includes growth
and reproduction. Energy budget can be calculated for each animal based on energy
measurements from fi eld and laboratory. Energy budgets are useful for estimating
energy available for growth and reproduction.
Food for healthy life: For a healthy life diet should contain correct proportions of
carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, water, fiber, essential mineral elements and vitamins.
Dietary deficiencies can have negative impact on health. When food intake exceeds
daily energy requirements especially in inactive individuals can lead to ill health
conditions specially diabetes mellitus and heart diseases. Some individuals develop
allergic reactions to foods such as pineapple, peanuts and tomatoes. Such individuals
should avoid these types of foods. Antioxidants present in the food material (e.g.
vitamin C and vitamin E) are also important in avoiding disorders in the alimentary
canal and maintaining a healthy life. As humans cannot synthesize all the required
antioxidants some of them should be obtained from the diet.
Malnutrition: Malnutrition can arise due to failure of obtaining an adequate nutrition
when the diet lacks one or more essential nutrients or consistently supplies less
chemical energy than the energy required by the body. According to the WHO if, body
mass index (BMI) is less than 18.5 is said to be malnutrition. BMI of a person is
calculated as follows,
BMI= Mass/ height2 (kg/ m2)
Obesity: Obesity arises when energy expenditure of a person is much less than the
energy intake. According to the WHO criteria, if the BMI is at 30.0 or over it is known
as obesity. This condition is a growing issue worldwide. Obesity can lead to many
diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, some cancers etc. 

Common disorders in the alimentary canal
Gastritis: gastritis is a condition resulting inflammation of the stomach which can
be due to several reasons. In gastritis, glands of the stomach wall are stimulated and
secrete excess HCl causing damage to the mucosa. Due to the damages of mucosa
layer of the stomach, blisters can be formed. Prolonged starvation and mental stress
are one of the reasons for the secretion of excess HCl. some drugs like aspirin can also
induce gastritis conditions. Longer lasting gastritis conditions is usually associated
with the infection by the acid tolerance bacterium Helicobacter pylori. As prolonged
starvation is one of the reasons for developing gastritis proper food habits should be
practiced to control this condition.
Constipation: Constipation occurs due to the slow movement of feces that promotes
the water reabsorption and as a result feces become more solid. Inhibition of the reflex
action in defecation may also leads to constipation. This leads to pain in the anus
and difficulty in defecating. Constipation can be controlled by developing behavioral
adjustments to carry out defecation properly. Intake of adequate fiber in the diet can
help prevent constipation. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
55,Animal Form and Function,Circulatory Systems in Animals,"Need of a circulatory system
A circulatory system is required in animals for transportation of materials within the
body and exchange of materials with the external environment. The simple animals
(e.g. Cnidarians, Flat worms) lack specialized system for the transport and distribution
of material because many or all cells are in direct contact with the external environment.
In these animals exchange of materials over the body surface through direct diffusion
is sufficient for their needs. In these animals those materials can be transported by
diffusion through short distance within the body.
As organisms increase in size and complexity, the amount of materials moving in and
out of the body also increases. The distance that materials have to be transported within
the body also increases and many cells are not in direct contact with their external
environment. Therefore diffusion is not sufficient to transport materials throughout
the body. Therefore circulatory systems have evolved in such organisms to exchange
materials between cells and their immediate surroundings.
Substances that are transported in the body
Substances that are transported in the body include respiratory gases (oxygen, carbon
dioxide), nutrients (glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, etc.), waste products of
metabolism (urea, ammonia, etc), hormones and antibodies. 

Blood circulatory systems in the animal kingdom
A circulatory system has three basic components: a muscular pumping device (heart),
interconnected vessels and a circulatory fluid (blood/ hemolymph). Circulatory fluid
flows through the vessels mainly due to the pressure generated by the heart. The
circulatory system functionally connects the fluid environment of the body cells to
the organs that exchange gases, absorb nutrients and dispose of wastes by transporting
fluids throughout the body. Various degrees of complexity in the arrangement of
circulatory systems can be seen in the animal kingdom.
Main circulatory systems in the animal kingdom
There are two types of circulatory systems among the animals: open circulatory system
and closed circulatory system.
The open circulatory system: It is a circulatory system in which a fluid called
hemolymph that bathes the tissues and organs directly. There is no distinction
between the circulatory fluid and the interstitial fluid surrounding cells. The heart
pumps hemolymph through the circulatory vessels into the spaces (interconnected
sinuses) which surround body tissues. Chemical exchange occurs directly between
the hemolymph and body cells. Back flow of the hemolymph takes place via the pores
(ostia) with valves found in the heart during the relaxation. The open circulatory
system has evolved in some invertebrate phyla such as Arthropoda and Mollusca
(some mollusc groups). 
The closed circulatory system: It is a circulatory system in which blood is restricted
to vessels and kept apart from the interstitial fluid. Blood is pumped by the heart/s into
large vessels. These large blood vessels branches into small vessels and they penetrate
into the organs. Chemical exchange occurs between the blood and the interstitial fluid
and interstitial fluid and body cells. It may contain one or more hearts. This type of
circulatory systems can be seen in vertebrates and invertebrates such as Annelids.
In comparison to open circulatory system enable effective delivery of oxygen and
nutrients to the cells of larger and more active animals due to relatively high blood
pressure. 

Organization of vertebrate circulatory systems: Single circulation and double
circulation
Vertebrates have a closed circulatory system where there are three main types of
blood vessels: arteries, veins and capillaries. Within each type blood flows in only
one direction. The blood vessels which carry blood from the heart to organs are called
arteries. When these arteries branch into smaller vessels within organs they are called
arterioles. They pass blood to capillaries which are microscopic vessels with thin and
porous walls. These are the places where materials exchange occurs between blood
and interstitial fluid surrounding body cells through diffusion. Capillaries converge
into venules and they converge into veins which carry blood back to the heart.
Single circulation
During single circulation, in a complete circulation through the entire body, blood
passes through the heart only once. In animals that demonstrate single circulation,
posses two chambers in the heart. They are atrium and ventricle.
During a single circulation, the oxygen poor blood returning from the body enters
atrium and pass into the ventricle. Then the ventricle is contracted, blood is pumped
into the capillary bed in the gills. There gas exchange occurs between the capillaries
and the external environment. The O
2 is diffused into the blood while CO2 is removed
from the blood. Next the oxygen enriched blood circulates throughout the body and
reaches the body cells through body capillaries. e.g.: Bony fishes, Cartilagenous fi shes
such as rays and sharks. 

Double circulation
During double circulation, in a complete circulation through the entire body, blood
passes through the heart twice. Such circulatory system consists of separate pulmonary
and systemic circuits in which blood passes through the heart after completing each
cycle. e.g. Amphibians, Reptiles, Aves, Mammals. Amphibians and most reptiles
have a three chambered heart: two atria and one ventricle. Birds and mammals have
a four chambered heart where heart is completely divided into left and right sides.
This arrangement allows the complete separation of oxygen enriched and oxygen poor
blood. The oxygen poor blood from systemic circulation flows to the right atrium of
the heart and then to the right ventricle. Right ventricle pumps blood into the lungs.
Oxygen enriched blood from the lungs reaches the left atrium and pass to the left
ventricle. The left ventricle pumps oxygen enriched blood into the systemic circulation.
Double circulation is more effective in supplying blood to all body organs and tissues
especially brain and muscles due to the higher pressure exerted by the heart in the
systemic circulation. This in contrast to single circulation where blood flows under
reduced pressure from the gas exchange organs to other organs. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
56,Animal Form and Function,Basic plan of human blood circulatory system and lymphatic system,"Basic plan of human blood circulatory system 

The human
heart consists of four chambers; they are two ventricles and two atria. There is a dual
circuit which operates simultaneously. The pulmonary circuit takes oxygen poor blood
to the respiratory surface, the lungs and returns the oxygen enriched blood back to
the heart while the systemic circuit supplies oxygen enriched blood to all organs and
tissues in the body and returns oxygen poor blood from organ and tissues back to
the heart. Each circuit consists of major arteries/ arteries, arterioles, capillary beds,
venules and veins/major veins.
During ventricular contraction, the right ventricle pumps the oxygen poor blood into
the two lungs via the pulmonary arteries. Then in the lungs O2 is loaded into the blood
through diffusion while CO2 is unloaded from blood into the external environment. 

This process occurs in the capillary beds in the left and right lungs. Then the oxygen
rich blood is transported into the left atrium via the two pulmonary veins. During
atrial contraction, this oxygen rich blood is transported into the left ventricle. During
ventricular contraction oxygen rich blood is pumped into the aorta. Through arteries
the aorta conveys this oxygen rich blood throughout the body. First the aorta branches
into the coronary arteries which supplies blood into the heart muscles. Then the aorta
branches into arteries, arterioles leading to capillary beds in the head and arms and the
capillary beds in the abdominal organs and legs. The exchange of gases occurs in the
capillary beds where O2 rich blood is diffused into the tissues while the CO2 rich blood
diffused into the blood capillaries. These blood capillaries rejoined to form venules
which direct oxygen poor blood into veins. Oxygen poor blood from trunk and hind
limbs is drained into the inferior vena cava and oxygen poor blood from the head, neck
and fore limbs are directed into the superior vena cava. The blood from both inferior
and superior vena cava is pumped into the right atrium where it is passed into the right
ventricle. This blood is directed to the pulmonary circuit as explained above.
Basic plan of human lymphatic system
The lymphatic system is closely connected with the blood circulatory system both
structurally and functionally. It consists of lymph vessels through which lymph
travels. Other structure in the lymphatic system includes lymph nodes, lymphoid
tissues (tonsils) and lymphoid organs (e.g. spleen and thymus). Lymph vessels consist
of tiny vessels and larger vessels. Tiny lymph vessels are in close contact with the
capillaries of the blood circulatory system. Lymph nodes are composed of connective
tissues and white blood cells.
The lymphatic system returns lost fluid and proteins from the blood capillaries back
into the blood. The lost fluid from the blood capillaries is called lymph when they are
inside the lymphatic system. The composition of the lymph is same as interstitial fluid.
Lymph vessels have valves. That prevents the backflow of the lymph. The lymph is
drained into veins at the base of the neck via two large ducts The rhythmic contraction
of the lymph vessel walls and skeletal muscle contraction help to move the lymph.
The functions of human lymphatic system include tissue drainage to maintain the blood
volume in the blood circulatory system, absorption of fat and fat soluble vitamins from
the small intestine and for immune responses.
Structure and function of the human heart
The human heart is roughly a cone shaped hollow muscular organ. The heart wall is
composed of three layers of tissues: Pericardium, Myocardium, Endocardium.
Pericardium: The pericardium is the outer most layers. It is made up of two sacs: The
outer fibrous pericardium and inner serous pericardium. 

Myocardium: Myocardium is the middle layer of the heart wall. It is composed of
specialized cardiac muscle found only in the heart. Running through the myocardium
is also a network of specialized conducting fibres responsible for transmitting the
heart’s electrical signals.
Enodocardium: Endocardium is the inner layer of the heart wall. It lines the chambers
and valves of the heart. It is a smooth membrane and consists of flattened epithelial
cells. It is continuous with the endothelium lining of the blood vessels. 

There are four chambers in the heart two upper atria and two lower ventricles. Ventricles
have to pump blood to the whole body where as atria pump blood to the ventricles
only. Therefore walls of the ventricles are thicker than walls of the atria. Wall of the
left ventricle is thicker than walls of the right ventricle because the right ventricle
pumps blood to the lungs which are closer to the heart whereas the left ventricle has to
pump blood throughout the body.
Therefore the blood entering the aorta from the left ventricle is at much higher blood
pressure than the blood entering the pulmonary artery from the right ventricle.
The heart is completely divided into a right and left side by a septum. The atria and
ventricles on each side are divided by an atrio-ventricular valve (AV). The right
atrioventricular valve has three flaps hence known as tricuspid valve and the left
atrioventricular valve has two flaps hence known as bicuspid valve. Conical shaped
papillary muscles are extensions of the inner wall of the ventricles. Atrio-ventricular
valves attached to the papillary muscles by fibrous cords which are called chordae
tendineae. Atrio-ventricular valves are anchored by strong fibres. This prevents the
valves from being turned inside out. Semilunar valves are found at the points where
the pulmonary artery and aorta leave the right and left ventricles respectively. These
valves prevent the backflow of blood into the ventricles.
Two pulmonary arteries with oxygen poor blood leave the heart from the upper part of
the right ventricle. Two pulmonary veins from each lung carry oxygen rich blood back
to the left atrium. The aorta with oxygen rich blood leaves from the upper part of the
left ventricles. The superior vena cava and inferior vena cava open into the right atrium
and empty their contents into the right atrium. The heart is supplied with arterial blood
by the right and left coronary arteries which branch from the aorta immediately after
the aortic valve.","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
57,Animal Form and Function,The conducting system of the heart,"Heart generates its own electrical impulses and beats independently of nervous or
hormonal control. However it is supplied with both sympathetic and parasympathetic
nerve fibers which increase and decrease respectively the intrinsic heart rate. In addition
to that heart responds to a number of circulating hormones including adrenaline and
thyroxine.
Small group of specialized neuromuscular cells in the myocardium initiate and conduct
impulses. The conducting system of the heart consists of following specialized system.
• SA node (Sinoatrial node)
• AV node (Atrioventricular node)
• Atrioventricular bundle (bundle of His), bundle branches and Purkinje fibres 

SA node / Sinoatrial node
SA node is a small mass of specialized cells. It lies in the myocardium of the right
atrium near the opening of the superior vena cava. The stimulus for contraction of
the heart originates in the ‘SA node’. The SA node initiates the heart beat and sets the
rhythm of the heart beat so it is called the pace maker. But the heart rate can be varied
by the stimulation from the autonomic nervous system, hormones such as adrenaline,
thyroxine and temperature.
AV node
AV node is also a small mass of specialized cells. It is situated between wall of the
left and right atria. The AV node transmits the electrical signals from the atria into the
ventricles.
Atrioventricular bundle (bundle of His), bundle branches and Purkinje fibres
AV bundle is a mass of fibers. It originates from the AV node. The AV bundle crosses the
fibrous rings that separate atria and ventricle at the upper end of the ventricular septum
it divides into right and left bundle branches. Within the ventricular myocardium the
branches break up into fine fibres. These fi ne fibers are Purkinje fibers. The AV bundle
branches and the Purkinje fibers transmit electrical impulse from the AV node to the apex
of the myocardium. As a result of this impulse, wave of ventricular contractions begin.
Then the contraction sweeps upwards and outwards pumping blood simultaneously
into the pulmonary artery and the aorta.","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
58,Animal Form and Function,The cardiac cycle,"The cardiac cycle refers to the sequences of events that take place in a complete heart
beat. During this process one complete cycle of pumping and filling of blood into the
heart occurs. Complete cardiac cycle lasts for 0.8 second. It occurs as follows:
1. Atrial systole – Contraction of the atria
2. Ventricular systole - Contraction of the ventricles
3. Complete cardiac diastole – Relaxation of the atria and ventricles
At rest the healthy adult heart is likely to beat at a rate of 60- 80 beats per minute.
During a single heart beat, the heart contracts (systole) and then relaxes (diastole).
During a single contraction the amount of blood pumped by a ventricle is called the
stroke volume. 

Complete cardiac diastole
This lasts for 0.4 second. Both atria and ventricles are relaxed and blood return to the
heart. The superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava transport oxygen poor blood
into the right atrium. At the same time as the four pulmonary veins bring oxygen rich
blood into the left atrium. The pressure of the atria is more than the pressure of the
ventricles. Therefore atrioventricular valves are open and some blood flows passively
through to the ventricles.
Atrial systole
When blood flows into the atrium SA node is stimulated. Then SA node triggers a wave
of contractions that spreads over the myocardium of both atria. Hence the remaining
blood in the atria flows into the ventricles thereby emptying the atria. This lasts for 0.1
second. 
Ventricular systole
Through the atrial muscles the electrical impulses reaches the AV node. Then AV node
triggers its own electrical impulses which quickly spread to the ventricular muscles
via the AV bundle, the bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers. This results in a wave of
contractions which sweep upwards from the apex of the heart across the wall of the
ventricles. As a result both ventricles contract.
The pressure in the right ventricle is more than the pressure in the pulmonary artery
and the pressure in the left ventricle is more than pressure in the aorta. Therefore
pulmonary valve and aortic valves open and blood flows into pulmonary artery and
aorta respectively.
The high pressure generated during ventricular contractions force the atrioventricular
values to close preventing backflow of blood into the atria. Ventricular systole lasts
for 0.3 seconds. When ventricles relax, the pressure within them falls. The pulmonary
and aortic valves close. Pressure within the pulmonary artery and aorta is more than
pressure within the ventricles. The valves of the heart and great vessels open and close
according to the pressure within the chambers of the heart. The sequence of opening
and closing of valves ensure that blood flows only in one direction.
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Electrical activity in the heart can be detected on the surface of the skin by placing
electrodes on the chest or limbs as the body tissues and fluids conduct electricity well.
Such a recording is called an electrocardiogram (ECG). The ECG indicates the spread
of the electrical signal generated by the SA node as it travels throughout the heart. The
normal ECG tracing of a healthy individual shows five waves which by convention
have been named P, Q, R, S and T. 

P wave - It represents the impulse from the SA node as it sweeps over the atria (atrial
depolarization).
QRS wave complex – Represents rapid spread of impulse from the AV node
throughout the ventricles and electrical activity of the ventricular muscles.( ventricular
depolarization)
T wave – Represents ventricular repolarization and relaxation of the ventricular
muscles. Due to the larger QRS complex, atrial repolarization which occurs during
ventricular contraction is not seen.
Information about the heart function of a person ( state of the myocardium and the
cardiac conduction system) can be obtained by examining the pattern of waves and the
time interval between cycles and parts of cycles.
Blood Pressure
The force that the blood exerts on the walls of blood vessels as it travels is referred to
as blood pressure. Blood pressure in the arteries of systemic circulation maintains the
essential flow of blood into and out of the organs of the body.
It is very important to keep blood pressure within normal limits. High blood pressure
could lead to damage blood vessels resulting in formation of clots or bleeding from
damaged sites. If the blood pressure falls too low, there will be inadequate blood flow
through tissue capillary beds. This will adversely affects the normal functioning of
vital organs such as the brain, heart and kidneys.
Blood pressure varies according to the time of day, the posture, gender, age, activity,
exercise and stress (Emotional states) of an individual. Blood pressure falls at rest and
during sleep. Blood pressure increases during excitement, fear or anxiety.
Systolic and diastolic pressure
Systolic pressure
Systolic pressure is the pressure produced within the arterial system when the left
ventricle contracts and pushes blood into the aorta. At rest , systolic pressure in a
normal healthy adult systolic pressure is about 120 mmHg.
Diastolic pressure
Diastolic blood pressure is the blood pressure within the arteries following ejection of
blood at complete cardiac diastole(when the heart is at rest. In a normal healthy adult
diastolic pressure is about 80 mmHg. 

Arerial blood pressure is measured by a sphygmomanometer. It is expressed as
Systolic pressure (mm Hg)/
Diastobic pressure (mm Hg)","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
59,Animal Form and Function,Hypertension and Hypotension,"Hypertension
Sustained elevated blood pressure above normal limits is called hypertension.
Consequences of hypertension are kidney damage, adrenal gland disorders, heart
attack (because of the increased heart rate and cardiac contraction), stroke(caused by
cerebral haemorrhage), damaged blood vessles which can lead to death
Risk Factors for Hypertension
• Obesity
• Diabetes mellitus
• Family history
• Smoking
• A sedentary life style
• High intake of salts
• High intake of alcohol
• Stress
• Deposition of low density lipoprotein (LDL) on artery walls.
Hypotension
Sustained reduction of blood pressure below normal limits is called hypotension.
Hypotension usually occurs as a complication of other condition such as shock,
Dengue hemorrhage fever, standing up suddenly from sitting or lying position, over
bleeding/ hemorrhage condition, fasting, low nutrition etc. Low blood pressure leads
to inadequate blood supply to the brain. Depending on the cause unconsciousness may
be brief (fainting) or prolonged possibly causing death.
Coronary circulation
The heart is supplied with arterial blood by the right and left coronary arteries which
branch from the aorta immediately distal to the aortic valve.
The coronary arteries travel the heart wall eventually forming a vast network of
capillaries. Most of the venous blood is collected into a number of cardiac veins that
joins to form the coronary sinus which opens into the right atrium. The remainder
passes directly into the heart chambers through little venous channels. 

Consequences of blockage of coronary arteries
The inner lining of the arteries can be thickened and harden leading to the condition
called atherosclerosis which occurs as a result of fatty deposits especially cholesterol
particles. This can affect the normal blood supply to the organs and tissues.
One or more branches of coronary arteries can be blocked due to atherosclerosis which
can be complicated by thrombosis (blood clot). Depending on the place (s) of the block
in the coronary arteries and the degree of blockage related parts of the heart muscle will
be deprived of oxygen and nutrients. Hence, narrowing of the arteries leads to chest
pain (Angina). The complete occlusion due to the blockage of one or more coronary
arteries leads to heart attacks (Myocardial infarction) which refers to the damage or
death of cardiac muscle tissue due to lack of adequate oxygen and nutrients. Due to
this, heart beat rhythm may be abnormal and the heart may cease to be an effective
pump. The other vital organs such as brain may be deprived of inadequate supply of
oxygen rich blood and heart attack may be fatal if not treated on time.
Stroke – Similarly blockage due to atherosclerosis or rupture of arteries supplying
blood to the brain may cause the death of nervous tissue due to lack of oxygen and
nutrients. This is refered to as stroke.
Respiratory pigments
Respiratory pigments are organic compounds which can combine with oxygen where
the partial pressure of oxygen is high and release oxygen where partial pressure
of oxygen is low. Since oxygen is less soluble in watery medium including blood,
transportation of oxygen from respiratory surface to the tissues/ organs is a problem
for complex animals. To overcome this problem animals have evolved the respiratory
pigments.
Different respiratory pigments can be seen in the animal kingdom:
• Haemoglobin- present in blood of human, other vertebrate and annelids
• Haemocyanin- present in hemolymph of arthropods and molluscs.
• Chlorocruorin- present in the blood of many annelids
• Haemoerythrin- present in the blood of marine invertebrates (some annelids)
• Myoglobin- present in vertebrate muscles
All these respiratory pigments except myoglobin transport oxygen from respiratory
surfaces to the tissues and organs and while transporting carbon dioxide from tissue/
organs to the respiratory surface for elimination. Myoglobin present in the muscle
tissue has an oxygen storage function. 
Transport of respiratory gases in human blood
Transport of oxygen
It is the hemoglobin molecule found in the erythrocytes which is responsible for the
transport of oxygen around the body. Hemoglobin is composed of four subunits.
Each subunit is composed of a globin protein and the haem group. Haem groups are
responsible for the characteristic red colour of the blood. A ferrous (iron) atom is
located within each haem group and each of these can combine reversibly with one
molecule of oxygen. Therefore each hemoglobin molecule can carry up to four oxygen
molecules.
Hb + 4O
2 HbO8
(Hemoglobin molecules) (Oxyhemoglobin)
Combination of oxygen with hemoglobin to from oxyhemoglobin
Transport of Carbon dioxide
Carbon dioxide is carried by the blood in different ways.
• As
HCO3??ions in the plasma (about 70%): When CO2 diffuses into the red blood
cells the enzyme carbonic anhydrase catalyze the combination of CO2 with
water to form bicarbonate ( HCO3??) and H+ ions. The HCO3??moves out of the
erythrocytes into the plasma
• As carbaminohemoglobin (about 23%): CO2 combined with protein group of
hemoglobin and form carbaminohemoglobin. Therefore CO2 does not compete
with oxygen binding sites in hemoglobin.
• Dissolved in plasma (about 7%): as free gas. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
60,Animal Form and Function,Composition and major functions of human blood,"Blood which is a connective tissue is composed of cells and plasma. Cellular
components of the blood are three types namely red blood cells, white blood cells and
platelets. Red blood cells, leukocytes and platelets are developed from the
bone marrow in the bones such as ribs, vertebrae, sternum and pelvis. Erythropoietin
hormone (from kidneys) stimulates the generation of red blood cells. 

Red blood cells (erythrocytes)
They are small biconcave disk-like cells. Mature erythrocytes lack nuclei. This
character helps to carry more hemoglobin molecules within the cell. They also lack
mitochondria thus they produce ATP via anaerobic respiration. If they produce ATP by
aerobic respiration that will reduce the O2 transport efficiency. They have about 120
days of life span.
Generally a micro liter of blood contains 4- 6 million red blood cells. This figure can
be varied depending on the gender and health status.
Main function of red blood cells is the transportation of O2 molecules. They also
transport CO2 molecules.
White blood cells (Leukocytes)
There are five types of leukocytes. They are Basophils, Lymphocytes, Eosinophils,
Neutrophils and monocytes. Main functions of leukocytes are body defense, phagocytic
engulfing and digesting microorganisms. Lymphocytes develop into T cells and B
cells. These cells increase immune response against foreign substances. 

Platelets
Platelets are derived from bone marrow cells. They also do not have nuclei and they
play a major role in blood clotting 

Blood plasma
Blood plasma consists of inorganic ions in dissolved forms, plasma proteins such as
albumin, antibodies and fibrinogen, nutrients, metabolic wastes, respiratory gases and
hormones. pH of human blood is around 7.4. Protein concentration in plasma is higher
than in interstitial fluid.
The dissolved ions in the plasma buffer and maintain the osmotic balance in the blood.
Albumin in the plasma also buffers the blood and antibodies are involved in defense.
Fibrinogen in the plasma aids in blood clotting. When the clotting factors are removed
from the plasma it is called as serum.
Major Functions of blood
• Transport of oxygen to organs and removal of carbon dioxide from the organs
and tissues
• Transport of soluble excretory materials to organs of excretion
• Transport of nutrients
• Transport of hormones from the glands where they are produced to target organs
• Defence against foreign invasions
• Aids in osmoregulation
Blood clotting
When a tissue is damaged, blood flows from it and coagulates to form a blood clot.
This prevents further blood loss and entry of pathogenic micro organisms which is of
clear survival value. In general the blood in undamaged vessels does not clot.
A highly complex series of reactions takes place in order for coagulation to occur as
well as prevent unwanted clotting. When the blood vessel is damaged the connective
tissues of the vessel wall is exposed. Therefore platelets in the blood adhere to the
collagen fibers in the connective tissue and release substance that makes close by
platelets sticky. This platelet plug provides instant protection against blood loss.
Then platelets release clotting factors. They trigger the formation of thrombin. Then
thrombin converts fibrinogen into fi brin. Next this fibrin aggregates into threads that
form a network of the clot. The activated thrombin is also involved in formation of
more thrombin which completes the formation of blood clot. 

Clotting does not occur in undamaged blood vessels because the lining of the vessels
is very smooth and does not promote platelet aggregation or cell rupture. Also some
substances such as Heparin prevent clotting. Heparin prevent the conversion of
prothrombin into thrombin and fibrinogen to fi brin and is widely used clinically as an
anticoagulant.
Grouping of blood
The surface of the red blood cells carries antigens called aggulitinogen (antigen A
and antigen B). In addition individuals have antibodies in plasma (anti–A and anti-B).
According to ABO blood grouping system there are four blood groups namely A, B, AB
and O. A person with a specific antigen in red cells does not possess the corresponding
antibody in the plasma. e.g. Anyone with antigen A on the red blood cell membrane
has no anti–A antibody in the plasma.
If red blood cells have antigen A and plasma has antibodies b (anti-B) that person’s
blood group is A
If red blood cells have antigen B and plasma with antibodies a (anti–A ) that person’s
blood group is B 

If red blood cells have both antigen ‘A’ and ‘B’ and plasma has no anti-A or anti- B
antibodies that person’s blood group is ‘AB’
If red blood cells have no antigen A or B but plasma has both antibodies (anti–A and
anti-B) that person’s blood group is ‘O’
When a patient receives a blood transfusion it is vital that they receive blood that is
compatible with their own. If it is incompatible a type of immune response occurs.
This is because the donor’s red cell membranes possess glycoprotein which act as
antigens and react with antibodies (agglutinin) in the recipient’s plasma. The result is
that the donor’s cells are agglutinated.
Therefore when transfusion occurs it is important to know blood group of donor and
recipient. People with blood group AB make neither anti–A nor– Anti-B antibodies.
Transfusion of type A, B or AB blood into these individuals is likely to be safe since
there are no antibodies to react with them. Person with AB blood group is known as
a universal recipient.
Individual with blood group O has neither antigen A nor antigen B on their plasma
membrane of red blood cells. but they do have antibodies (anti–A and anti-B) in their
plasma. So these individuals having blood group O can donate blood to the persons
with any blood group. A person with the blood group O is known as a universal donor.
Therefore prior to transfusion cross-matching is still required to ensure that there is no
reaction between donor and recipient blood.
The Rhesus system
Some individuals have antigen called Rhesus factor on the plasma membrane of red
blood cells. Individuals having this factor on the red blood cells are called Rh+ and
those who do not have this factor are called Rh-.
Rh+ individuals do not have anti Rhesus antibodies in the plasma while individuals
who are Rh- have anti-Rhesus antibodies in their plasma. However if Rh + blood enters
a Rh- negative individual the recipient responds by manufacturing Rh antibodies in
the blood plasma.
When a Rh- mother bears a Rhesus positive (Rh+) child during delivery few Rh+ red
blood cells of the fetus may enter the mother’s circulation and cause the mother to
produce Rh antibodies in her plasma. If the mother is pregnant for the second time
with a Rhesus positive fetus, the Rh antibodies developed in her plasma in response
to the first child’s red blood sells can pass across the placenta to the fetus and destroy
fetal red cells. Normally Rh antibodies are not formed in large enough quantities in the
mother’s plasma to affect the first born child. However subsequent Rh+ children can
suffer destruction of their red blood cells. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
61,Animal Form and Function,Human Respiratory System,"Gross structure and function of the human respiratory system
Human respiratory system consists of the following major parts: nostrils, nasal cavity,
pharynx, larynx, a series of branching ducts starting from the trachea, two bronchi
one leading to each lung and smaller bronchioles, which finally end in air sacs called
alveoli. The bronchioles and the alveoli are contained within the paired, cone-shaped
lungs located in the thoracic cavity. The two lungs differ slightly in shape and size.
The left lung is slightly smaller than the right because the apex of the heart is slightly
to the left of the median plane and it has 2 lobes while the right lung has 3 lobes. Each
lung is surrounded by two membranes. The inner membrane, called the visceral pleura
adheres to the outer surface of the lungs while the outer membrane called the parietal
pleura adheres to the wall of the thoracic cavity. Between these two membranes there
is a thin, fluid filled space.
During respiration, air enters the respiratory system through the nostrils. In the nasal
cavity air is filtered by hairs and is warmed and humidified as it travels through spaces
in the nasal cavity. The nasal cavity leads to the pharynx which is a common passage
for both air and food. That means air passage and food passage cross each other.
During swallowing of food the larynx moves upwards which allows the epiglottis
to close the opening of the larynx called the glottis. This allows food to go down the
esophagus to the stomach. The rest of the time the glottis is open so that air can move
from the pharynx through the larynx to the trachea. In the larynx are vocal cords which
are made up of largely elastic fibers. These vocal cords help produce sound when
expired air rushes across the stretched or tensed vocal cords, causing them to vibrate.
Both the walls of the larynx and trachea are strengthened by cartilage that help these
airways to keep open. The air passes from the trachea into the two bronchi that lead
into each lung. Within the lungs the air passes through smaller and smaller branches of
the bronchi called bronchioles.
The epithelium found in the major branches of this respiratory tract has cilia and a thin
film of mucus. The mucus helps trap the dust and other particulate contaminants in the
inhaled air. Then the beating of cilia moves this mucus upwards towards the pharynx
where it is swallowed into the esophagus. This process is referred to as the “mucus
escalator”. It helps clean the respiratory system. 

At the tips of tiniest bronchioles are large number of small air sacs clustered together.
The air passes into these air sacs called alveoli where gas exchange occurs. The walls
of the alveoli are made up of a single layer of flattened epithelial cells that lack cilia.
This inner lining of the alveoli is coated by a thin film of fluid. The lungs contain
millions of alveoli. This allows a large surface area for gas exchange. Each alveolus is
also surrounded by a network of capillaries. Oxygen in the air that enters the alveoli
dissolves in the moist film and rapidly diffuse across the thin epithelium into the
capillaries. Meanwhile a net diffusion of carbon dioxide occurs from the capillaries
into the alveoli. Since there are no cilia in the alveoli, there are white blood cells
in the alveoli to engulf foreign particles. Alveoli are also coated with a surfactant
that reduces the surface tension thereby preventing the collapse of alveoli due to high
surface tension. 

Mechanism of ventilation of the lungs
• Ventilation of the lungs is necessary to maintain high oxygen and low carbon
dioxide concentrations in the alveoli or the gas exchange surface.
• Ventilation is accomplished by breathing, which is the alternating movement of
air into (inhalation) and out of (exhalation) the lungs.
• Humans employ what is referred to as negative pressure breathing where air is
pulled rather than pushed into lungs.
• Inhalation is an active process. Contraction of rib muscles or intercoastal muscles
and the diaphragm which is a sheet of skeletal muscle that forms the bottom of
the thoracic cavity leads to the expansion of the thoracic cavity.
• The visceral and parietal pleurae surrounding the lung stick together due to
the surface tension of the fluid between these two membranes. This allows the
two membranes to slide smoothly past each other. Hence, as the volume of the
thoracic cavity increases, the lung volume increases as well.
• As a result, the pressure within the lungs decrease relative to the outside air.
• This creates a pressure gradient between the atmosphere and the lungs.
• Thus, air flows from a high pressure gradient in the atmosphere to a lower
pressure gradient in the lungs.
• During exhalations which is usually a passive process, the rib muscles and the
diaphragm relax. This cause the volume of the thoracic cavity to reduce.
• As a result, the pressure inside the lungs increase in relation to the air outside.
This pressure forces air to move out of the lungs through the respiratory tubes
into the atmosphere.
• When a man is at rest contraction of rib muscles and contraction of diaphragm
are enough for breathing.
• However, depending on the activity level, additional muscles may be used to aid
breathing such as muscles of the neck, back and chest. These muscles further
help to increase the volume of the thoracic cavity by raising the rib cage. e.g.
during exercise 

• The lungs serve as an efficient respiratory surface because:
• Alveoli create a large surface area for gas exchange.
• Alveoli and capillary walls are both lined by simple squamous epithelia which
reduce the distance the gasses need to travel by diffusion.
• The alveoli surface is moist to dissolve respiratory gasses for diffusion.
• Alveoli are highly vascularized which enables the maintenance of a steep
diffusion gradient of respiratory gasses
Gas exchange at the alveoli and in the tissues is a continuous process. It requires
transport of O2 from the lungs to the blood and movement of CO2 from the blood
(referred to as external respiration) and movement of O2 from blood to the tissues and
CO
2 from tissues to the blood (referred to as internal respiration). 

Diffusion of O
2 and CO2 requires partial pressure gradients between the alveolar air in
the lungs and blood (during external respiration) and blood and tissues (during internal
respiration).
During inhalation, fresh air mixes with the stale air in the lungs. This mixture in
the lungs has a higher partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) and a lower partial pressure
of carbon dioxide (PCO2) than the blood in the alveolar capillaries. There is thus a
concentration gradient favoring the diffusion of these two gases in opposite directions.
Net diffusion of O
2 takes place from the air in the alveoli to the blood and net diffusion
of CO
2 takes place from the blood into the alveoli.
When O
2 molecules diffuses into blood capillaries they bind to heamoglobin in the red
blood cells. Four molecules of O
2 bind reversibly with one molecule of haemoglobin
and form oxyhaemoglobin.
Hb + 4 O2= HbO8
When blood leaves the alveolar capillaries the oxygen and carbon dioxide partial
pressures are in equilibrium with those of alveoli air. Once this blood returns to the
heart, it is pumped through the systemic circuit.
Blood reaching the tissues in the systemic capillaries have a higher PO2 and a lower
PCO
2 than in the tissues. These partial pressure gradients result in the net diffusion
of O
2 from the blood stream into the tissue and CO2 diffusion from the cells into the
blood stream across the extracellular fluid/interstitial fluid. This is called unloading of
O
2 and loading of CO2 . Then the blood returns to heart and pumped to lungs again. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
62,Animal Form and Function,Homeostatic control of Breathing,"• Typically breathing is regulated by involuntary mechanisms. These involuntary
mechanisms help coordinate gas exchange with blood circulation and metabolic
demands
• Medulla oblongata is the main breathing regulating center found at the base
brain. There are a pair of breathing control centers found in medulla and they are
responsible for regulating the breathing rhythm.
• A negative-feedback mechanism is involved in regulating this process. Sensors
which detect stretching of the lung tissues are found in the lungs. During
inhalation, these sensors send nerve impulses to the neurons that act as control
circuits in the medulla and further inhalation is inhibited and this prevents the
lungs from over expanding.
• To regulate breathing, the medulla depends on pH changes in tissue fluids. The
pH of tissue fluid is an indicator of blood carbon dioxide concentration. For 
example, when metabolic activities increase, the concentration of CO2 in the
blood increases. Because CO
2 diffuse into the cerebrospinal fluid, this results in
an increase of CO
2 concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid as well. There CO2
reacts with water and form carbonic acid (H2CO3). H2CO3 dissociate into HCO3-
and H+
CO
2 + H2O H2CO3 HCO3- + H+
• Hence, a high CO2 concentration results in an increase in H+ concentration,
thereby a lower pH.
• This pH change is detected by the sensors in the medulla and in major blood
vessels called arteries and aorta.
• Sensors in the medulla and major blood vessels detect this decrease in pH. In
response, the control circuits in medulla increase the depth and rate of breathing
until the excess CO
2 is removed in exhaled air and the pH of blood comes to its
normal value which is 7.4
• The O
2 level has little influences on the breathing control centers. But, when O2
concentration becomes very low, O2 sensors found in the aorta and the carotid
arteries send impulses to the medulla to increase the breathing rate.
• The regulation of breathing is also modulated by additional neural circuits in the
pons, a part of the brain stem found above the medulla. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
63,Animal Form and Function,Disorders of the respiratory system,"The effect of smoking on the smooth functioning of the respiratory system
• Cigarette smoke harms nearly every organ in the body including the organs
of the respiratory system and increase the risk of illness, disability and death.
Smokers inhale large number of chemicals which mainly come from burning
tobacco. Some of these inhaled compounds are chemically active and can trigger
damaging changes in the body.
• Nicotine is among the compounds inhaled in tobacco smoke which is the
addictive drug in the smoke. It temporarily increases the rate of heart beat and
constriction of peripheral blood vessels causing a temporary increase in blood
pressure.
• Cigarette smoke stimulates the secretion of mucus by the goblet cells and inhibits
the action of cilia in the respiratory tract causing accumulation of mucus in
bronchioles and blocking them, leading to bronchial inflammation or bronchitis.
As a result, breathing may become difficult.
• Some chemicals such as hydrogen cyanide in cigarette smoke stops the cilia
from working properly. Due to loss of action of cilia, dust and other particulate
matter get collected in the lung, resulting in an increase in phagocytic cells in
the lung tissue. Due to release of large amounts of lytic enzymes by these cells,
the alveolar tissue is destroyed thus reducing the effective area available for gas
exchange.
• Carbon monoxide (CO) present in tobacco smoke is absorbed into the blood
and is able to bind to hemoglobin better than oxygen and combines irreversibly
with hemoglobin. Thus it decreases the amount of oxyhaemoglobin produced.
Therefore, oxygen transport through blood is decreased.
• Tobacco smoke also contains a large number of cancer-causing substances
(carcinogens). Nearly 90% of lung cancers are due to smoking. Long term
exposure to such chemicals in cigarette smoke results in the proliferation of cells
in the bronchial epithelium, forming a mass of abnormal cells. A cancer may
develop among these cells. If these cells break free, the cancer may spread to
other parts of the lungs and or to other organs.
• Passive or second hand smoking will also result in the above mentioned ill
effects.
Silicosis
This may be caused by long-term exposure to dust containing silica compounds. High
risk industries are,
• Quarrying granite, slate, sandstone 
• Mining hard coal, gold, tin, copper
• Stone masonry and sand blasting
• Glass and pottery work
When silica particles are inhaled they accumulate in the alveoli. These particles are
ingested by macrophages, some of which remain in the alveoli and come out in to the
connective tissue around bronchioles and blood vessels close to the pleura. Progressive
fibrosis is stimulated which eventually obliterates the blood vessels and respiratory
bronchioles. Gradual destruction of lung tissue eventually leads to pulmonary
hypertension and heart failure.
Asbestos related diseases - Asbestosis
Those who are involved in making or using products containing asbestos are at risk.
This occurs when asbestos fibers are inhaled with dust. In spite of their large size
the particles penetrate the level of respiratory bronchioles and alveoli. Macrophages
accumulate in the alveoli and the shorter asbestos fibers are ingested. The larger fibers
are surrounded by macrophages, protein materials and iron deposits. The macrophages
that have engulfed fibers move out of the alveoli and accumulate around respiratory
bronchioles and blood vessels, stimulating the formation of fibrous tissue. These cause
progressive destruction of lung tissue and pulmonary hypertension.
Lung cancer
Nearly 90% of lung cancer is due to smoking. When one smokes, the nasal hairs, mucus
and cilia in the respiratory tract that otherwise is sufficient to protect the lung from
chemical and biological irritants, are overwhelmed and eventually stop functioning.
As a result, irritants, free radicals, carcinogens and pathogens accumulate in the lungs.
Eventually these cause lung cancer.
Tuberculosis (TB)
Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium
tuberculosis. The bacterium spreads when an infected person coughs and the bacterium
enters the body of an uninfected person through inhaled air. The most common form is
Pulmonary TB which affects the lungs. Other organs may also be affected. Transmission
of pulmonary TB is by inhaling the bacterium into the lungs. This bacterium can survive
in the air and in the house dust for long periods. Malnutrition and other infectious can
reduce resistance to the disease.
Symptoms
Loss of appetite, loss of weight, excessive sweating, fever, a racking cough and spitting
up blood. 
Asthma
Asthma is characterized by wheezing and chest tightness causing breathing difficulty.
This is caused by the sudden contractions of smooth muscles in the walls of the
bronchioles which causes the bronchioles to narrow or even close. During this time
breathing causes whistling or wheezing sound. The cause of asthma is an over reaction
of an immune response to stimuli like pollen, dust, mites, spores, particular food, cold
air, exercise, smoking gases. Anti-inflammatory drugs help control.
Respiratory cycle and lung volumes and capacities
Inhalation and exhalation during a single breath is referred to as a respiratory cycle.
The amount of air that flows in and out of the lungs depends on the conditions of
inspiration and expiration. Thus, four respiratory volumes are described.
• Tidal volume (TV): This is the volume of air inhaled and exhaled with each
breath during normal breathing. On average it is about 500 ml in a resting adult
human.
• Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV): This is the extra volume of air that can be
forcibly inhaled beyond the tidal volume.
• Expiratory reserve volume (ERV): The extra volume of air which can be
expelled from the lungs after a tidal expiration.
• Residual volume (RV): The volume of air that remains in the lungs even after
forceful expiration. This is on average is about 1,200 ml.
Specific combinations of respiratory volumes are called respiratory capacities. Thus,
respiratory capacities always consist of two or more lung volumes. The respiratory
capacities are important to determine the respiratory status of a person.
• Inspiratory capacity (IC): The total volume of air that can be inspired after a
tidal expiration.
Thus, IC = TV + IRV
• Functional residual capacity (FRC): The volume of air remaining in the lungs
at the end of a tidal expiration.
Thus, FRC = RV + ERV
• The functional residual capacity is important for continuous exchange of gas in
the alveoli and to prevent the collapse of the alveoli during expiration.
• Vital capacity (VC): The maximum volume of air which can be inhaled and
exhaled. It is normally around 3100 mL in women and 4800 mL in men.
VC = TV + IRV + ERV 
• Total lung capacity (TLC): The maximum volume of air the lungs can hold or
the sum of all lung volumes. This is normally around 6000 mL.
In addition, some of the inspired air fills the system of branching conducting tubes
(trachea, bronchi and bronchioles) and never contributes to the gas exchange in the
alveoli. This volume is referred to as the anatomical dead space and it is typically
about 150 mL.","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
64,Animal Form and Function,Immunity,"The state of being resistance to injury, invading pathogens and foreign substances
through defensive mechanisms in the body is known as immunity. Pathogens which
are the agents that can cause infectious diseases include some bacteria, virus, and
fungi. The substances that can be recognized as foreign to the body include chemical
components of pollen grains, incompatible blood cells and transplanted tissues.
Defenses in the animal body against these foreign invasions make up the immune
system. Immune system of animals should be able to distinguish own body cells (self)
from foreign cells/particles within the body (non-self) for initiating defensive immune
responses for destruction of the foreign agents such as pathogens. Special cell types
in the body fluid and tissues of most animals can interact with these foreign invasions
and destroy them. Immune cells produce receptor molecules that bind specifically to
molecules from foreign cells and agents and activate defense responses.
Immune responses in animals can be divided into two types:
• Innate immunity
• Acquired immunity (Adaptive immunity)
Innate immunity
Innate immunity is the ability to resist damage or diseases in the body through inherent
body defenses which offer rapid responses against a broad range of pathogens and
foreign substances. In innate immunity, recognition and defense responses will
depend on characters common to groups of pathogens. Innate immunity lacks specific
responses to specific invaders and its protective mechanisms functions the same way
regardless of the type of the invader. Hence innate immunity is also known as nonspecific defense. Innate immune responses include defense mechanisms that provide
immediate but general protection against foreign invasion. Innate immunity is found in
both invertebrates and vertebrates. Innate defense mechanisms can be broadly divided
into two types: External barriers (External defenses/ barrier defense) and Internal
nonspecific defenses (Internal defenses).
External defenses/ barrier defense in innate immunity
External barriers discourage pathogens and foreign substances from penetrating the
body. So they are considered as the first line of defense. For innate immunity in the
human body, external defenses/barriers are found in the skin, mucus membranes and
secretions of various organs. They act as physical and chemical barriers. 
• Human skin with its many layers of closely packed, keratinized cell layers in
the epidermis provides a significant physical barrier to entrance of microbes. In
addition periodic shedding of epidermal cells helps remove microbes from the
skin surface.
• The mucous membranes which line the body cavities provide a physical barrier
to entrance of many microbes (e.g. the linings of the respiratory tract, digestive
tract, urinary tract and reproductive tract). The mucous membranes produce
mucus which traps microbes and other particles. In the respiratory tract, ciliated
epithelial cells sweep mucus and any entrapped material upward. Coughing and
sneezing speed up the mucus movement and its entrapped pathogens out of the
body preventing their entry to the lungs.
• Secretions by various organs (e.g. tears, saliva, mucus) help as physical and
chemical barriers to protect epithelial surface of the skin and mucous membranes.
Tears in the eyes provide protection against irritants and microbes. Tears in
the eyes provide continuous washing action that helps to dilute microbes and
prevent settling on the surface of eyes. Saliva washes microbes from the mouth
surface and the flow of saliva reduces the colonization of microbes in the mouth.
Mucus secretions which bathe various exposed epithelia provide a continual
washing action to dilute and inhibit colonization microbes such as bacteria and
fungi. Lysozyme (an enzyme) present in tears, saliva, perspiration and mucous
secretions can destroy cell walls of some bacteria. Gastric juice which provides
an acidic environment in the stomach can destroy many bacteria and bacterial
toxins ingested with food. Secretions of the sweat and sebaceous glands of the
skin give acidity of the skin which helps to prevent growth of bacteria.
Internal defenses in Innate immunity
When the pathogens penetrate the external defensive barriers in the skin and mucus
membranes in the human body, they encounter a second line of innate immunity
responses called internal defenses. Within the body, detection of non-self is
accomplished by molecular recognition in which receptor molecules on specific cells
in the immune system will bind specifically to molecules of foreign agents such as
pathogens.
In innate immunity, internal defenses consist of Phagocytic cells, Natural killer cells,
Antimicrobial proteins and Inflammatory responses.
• Phagocytic cells: These are specialized cells that can ingest microbes, foreign
particles and cell debris for intra cellular digestion and destruction. Phagocytes
use the receptor molecules to detect components of foreign agents and particles.
Neutrophils and Macrophages are the two main types of phagocytic cells in man.
While circulating in the blood, neutrophils are attracted first to the infected site 

by signals from affected tissues. Then neutrophils can ingest and destroy infected
pathogens. Macrophages are larger and more potent phagocytic cells.
• Natural killer cells: These are a type of lymphocytes present in the blood and
some tissue/organs such as spleen and lymph nodes which function in nonspecific
defense. They can detect the cells with abnormal surface molecules (e.g. virusinfected body cells and some cancerous cells) and kill them. Natural killer cells
do not engulf these abnormal cells but upon binding they can release chemicals
to kill the virus-infected cells and cancerous cells which could inhibit further
spread of the virus or cancer.
• Antimicrobial proteins: They are proteins present in the blood and interstitial fluids
which function in innate defense by attacking microbes directly or impeding their
reproduction. Interferons and Complement proteins are two such antimicrobial
proteins that discourage microbial growth. Interferons are proteins secreted by
virus-infected body cells that protect uninfected host cells from viral infections
by interfering with the viral replication. Once released by virus-infected cells,
interferons diffuse to uninfected neighboring cells where they are stimulated to
produce “anti-viral proteins” which inhibit viral replication. Some interferons
activate macrophages which enhance the phagocytic activity. Complement
proteins are a group of normally inactive proteins in the blood plasma and
plasma membranes. When they are activated by different substances present
on the surfaces of microbes, a cascade of biochemical reaction occurs which
lead to lysis of invaded cells. They also promote phagocytosis and inflammatory
response.
• Inflammatory response: This is an innate immune defense response in the
body to tissue damage triggered by microbial infections or injury of the tissues.
This involves the release of substances that promote increased permeability
and dilation of blood vessels, enhance migration of phagocytes, destruction of
invading pathogens and aid in tissue repair (Figure 5.31). Inflammation attempts
to destroy the microbes at the site of the injury preventing the spread to other
tissues and promote tissue repair.
Inflammatory response is brought about by various signaling molecules upon infection
or injury. Histamine is one of the important inflammatory signaling molecules released
mainly by mast cells in the connective tissues at the site of damage. Histamine causes
increased permeability and dilation of nearby blood vessels (blood capillaries).
Increased permeability of the blood vessels enhance the infiltration of white blood
cells, antimicrobial proteins and clotting elements to enter the injured area from the
blood that aid in destruction of invading pathogens and tissue repair. Dilation of blood
vessels allows more blood to flow through the damage area which helps to remove
dead cells. Activated phagocytes (macrophages and neutrophils) moved from the 

blood to the damaged tissue area can also discharge signaling molecules (cytokines)
which also promote blood flow to the injured or infected site. During inflammation,
activated complement proteins can cause further histamine release which attracts more
phagocyte cells to enter injured tissue and carry out additional phagocytosis. This
process can digest the microbes and cell debris at the site of injury.
Signs and symptoms of inflammation are redness, heat, swelling and pain. Dilation of
blood vessels causes redness and heat production due to high metabolism in the area.
Increased permeability of blood vessels triggers localized swelling due to leaking of
tissue fluid into neighboring tissues. Pain results from injury to neurons and microbial
toxins. As a result of most inflammatory responses, pus may be accumulated. It is a
fluid rich in dead phagocytes, dead pathogens and cell debris from the damaged tissue.
Minor injury or infection causes a localized inflammatory response. If the injury or
infection is severe it may lead to a systemic response (throughout the body) leading
to fever. Elevated body temperature within limits may enhance the phagocytosis and
accelerate tissue repair by speeding up the chemical reactions. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
65,Animal Form and Function,Acquired Immunity (Adaptive Immunity),"Acquired immunity is the ability of the body to defend itself against invading foreign
agents (e.g. pathogens) through specific defense responses mediated by diverse
T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. Acquired immunity shows (i) specificity for
particular foreign molecules (ii) recognition of animals own molecules (self-molecules)
from non-self-molecules and (iii) memory for most previously encountered pathogens
such that the subsequent encounter causes a stronger and more rapid response
(immunological memory). In the animal kingdom, acquired immunity is found only in
the vertebrates. 

In acquired immunity, two types of immune responses are mediated by
T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. They are Cell mediated immune responses and
Humoral immune responses. Humoral immune response is also called as Antibody
mediated immune response. Both immune responses are triggered by antigens. A given
pathogen may provoke both types of immune responses.
Cell mediated immune response
Cell mediated immune response is a type of acquired immunity in which specifically
sensitized T lymphocytes attach to the antigen undergo proliferation and eventually
differentiate into “Cytotoxic T cells” that can directly kill the cells with the invading
antigen . In addition “Memory T cells” are formed that can cause stronger and more
rapid response at the subsequent encounter of the same antigen to the body. This is
particularly effective against infected cells (fungi, parasites and virus that are present
within host cells), some cancer cells and foreign transplanted cells. Cell mediated
immunity always involves cells attacking cells.
Humoral immune response
Humoral immune response is a type of acquired immunity in which specifically
sensitized B lymphocytes attach to a particular antigen undergo proliferation and
eventually differentiate into “Plasma cells” that secrete circulating antibodies that can
neutralize and inactivate the specific toxins and pathogens in the blood and lymph. In
addition “Memory B cells” are formed that can cause stronger and more rapid response
at subsequent encounter of the same antigen. Humoral immune response works mainly
against antigens present in body fluids and extracellular pathogens (mainly bacteria)
that multiply in the body fluids.
Antibodies
Antibodies are proteins secreted by plasma cells (differentiated B lymphocytes) in
response to specific antigens; the antibody binds with that antigen to neutralize, inhibit
or destroy it. Antibodies can neutralize and inactivate the specific toxins and pathogens
in the body fluids. The antibodies do not directly kill the pathogens but can interfere
with activity of the pathogen or mark the pathogen for inactivation and destruction.
Antibody-antigen complexes can activate complement system and phagocytosis to
destroy the pathogen. Antibodies are also called as immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulin
has the same Y shaped structure as B lymphocyte antigen receptors but are secreted
than membrane bound. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
66,Animal Form and Function,Role of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes in acquired immunity,"Recognition of the antigen, binding to the antigen and sensitization:
For an acquired immune response to occur, some T lymphocytes or B lymphocytes
must first recognize that a foreign antigen is present in the body. Even though there
are vast variety of antigen receptors present on different B lymphocytes and T
lymphocytes, only a very small fraction are specific for a particular epitope. Hence,
antigen should be presented to the B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes until a match
is made. Recognition of the antigen occurs through successful match between an
epitope of the antigen and an antigen receptor on small number of B lymphocytes
or T lymphocytes. As specific antigen receptors produced by a single T cell or B cell
can be identical they can bind to the same epitope. Hence, both T and B cells can
respond to any pathogen that produces molecules containing that same epitope. But B
cells and T cells encounter antigens in different ways. T lymphocytes only recognize
the fragments of antigenic proteins that are presented to the cells by a special cells
called “antigen presenting cells” (macrophages, dendritic cells and B cells). However,
B lymphocytes can recognize and bind to the antigens present in blood plasma, lymph
and interstitial fluid. The binding of an antigen to the specific antigen receptor results
in sensitization (activation) of a specific T lymphocyte or B lymphocyte which initiates
cell mediated and antibody mediated immune response as described below.
Proliferation and differentiation into Effector cells: Once activated the T lymphocyte
or B lymphocyte undergoes multiple cell divisions (proliferations) resulting a clone, a
population of cells that are identical to the original lymphocyte. Some cells of clones
become Effectors cells which are short lived cells that take effect immediately against
antigen to provide primary immune responses.
Elimination of invaders: The effector forms of T lymphocyte are “Cytotoxic T cells”
and “Helper T cells”. Cytotoxic T cells use toxic proteins to kill the cells infected
with the pathogen. Signals from Helper T cells activate cytotoxic T cells to kill the
infected cells. Signals from Helper T cells can also activate B lymphocytes to initiate
antibody production. Effector forms of B lymphocytes are “Plasma cells”. A single
activated B lymphocyte can form thousands of identical Plasma cells. The plasma cells
begin producing and secreting a soluble form of the B lymphocyte antigen receptor
(antibodies) in large quantities which are released to the blood and lymph. Hence,
circulating antibodies can neutralize and inactivate the specific toxins and pathogens
in the body fluids.
Provide immunological memory: Following differentiation into Effector T cells
(Cytotoxic T cells and Helper T cells), other T lymphocytes in the clones remain as
“Memory T cells” which are long lived that can give rise to Effector T cells if the same antigen is encountered later in the life. Similarly the remaining B lymphocytes in the
clones are “Memory B cells” which are long lived that can give rise to Plasma cells if
the same antigen is encountered later in the life. These Memory T cells and Memory
B cells can cause stronger and more rapid response at subsequent encounter of the
same antigen to the body. This immunological memory is called secondary immune
responses.
Active immunity
Active immunity is a long lasting immunity mediated by the action of B lymphocytes
and T lymphocytes in the body and the resulting B and T memory cells specific for
a pathogen. Active immunity can be developed as a result of natural infection of a
pathogen or artificial immunization.
Naturally acquired active immunity
Long lasting immunity developed in the body against various infectious diseases in
response to natural infections of pathogens is called naturally acquired active immunity.
In response to a disease causing agent entering the body naturally for the first time (e.g.
Virus of Chickenpox), some T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes in the body become
activated and eventually produce specific cytotoxic T cells and antibodies to destroy
the pathogen. Memory B cells and T cells produced in this process are long lived that
will provide a stronger and rapid immune responses to destroy the particular antigen
if the same antigen (e.g. Virus of Chickenpox) is encountered later in the life. In this
way the body can resist to subsequent infections of the same antigen.
Artificially acquired active immunity
Long lasting immunity induced artificially in the body against various infectious
diseases through vaccination (immunization) of attenuated (virulence-reduced)
pathogens is called artificially acquired active immunity. Immunization can be carried
out with preparations of antigens (vaccines) from many sources such as killed or
weakened pathogens, inactivated bacterial cells or genes encoding microbial proteins.
These vaccines act as the antigens and stimulate cell mediated and antibody mediated
immune responses leading to production of long lived memory B and T cells to destroy
the antigen. If the pathogen from which the antigen was derived, is encountered
naturally later in the life, long lived memory cells can provide a stronger and rapid
immune responses to destroy the particular pathogen. In general, the antigens used
in the vaccines are pretreated to be immunogenic but not pathogenic. For example,
BCG vaccine which is used against tuberculosis disease in man, has been prepared
from a strain of the attenuated live tuberculosis bacteria. Polio vaccine consists of live
attenuated poliovirus strains. Polio vaccine produces antibodies in the blood against
polio virus, and in the event of infection, this protects the individual by preventing the
spread of poliovirus to the nervous system. 

(e.g. penicillin), venom from honey bees and wasps. Whenever an allergic reaction
takes place the tissue injury occurs. The most allergens stimulate production of plasma
cells which secrete antibodies specific for the antigen. When the same allergen enter the
body later, it become attach to the antibodies specific to the allergen which induce the
mast cells to release histamine and other inflammatory chemicals. Acting on a variety
of cell types these signals bring about typical allergy symptoms such as sneezing,
runny nose, teary eyes and smooth muscle contractions in the airways of the lungs
that can result in breathing difficulties. An acute allergic conditions sometimes lead
to death of the person due to breathing difficulties and low blood pressure with a few
seconds of exposure to an allergen.
Autoimmune diseases
In some persons, the immune system becomes active against particular self-molecules
of the body and begins to attack the person’s own tissues leading to an autoimmune
disease. Possible causes for autoimmune diseases may be genetic factors, gender and
unknown environmental triggers. Many autoimmune diseases affect females than
males. A variety of mechanisms produce different autoimmune diseases. Some involve
the production of autoantibodies that can affect normal functioning of certain body
molecules. Some involve activation of Cytotoxic T cells that destroy certain body
cells. Examples for autoimmune diseases include Type 1 Diabetes mellitus, Multiple
sclerosis and Rheumatoid arthritis. In Type 1 Diabetes mellitus, T cells attack the
insulin producing pancreatic beta cells. In Multiple sclerosis, T cells attack myelin
sheaths around neurons. In Rheumatoid arthritis, painful inflammations of the cartilage
and bones occur as the immune system mistakenly sends antibodies to the lining of the
joints, where they attack the tissue surrounding the joints.
Immunodeficiency diseases
Immunodeficiency disease is a disorder in which responses of the immune system
to antigens are defective or absent. An immunodeficiency can lead to frequent
and recurrent infections and increased susceptibility to certain cancers. An inborn
immunodeficiency results from a genetic or developmental defects in the production
of immune system cells or specific proteins such as antibodies or proteins of the
complement system. Acquired immunodeficiency can be developed later in life due
to the exposure to chemicals or biological agents. Drugs used to fight autoimmune
diseases or prevent transplant rejections suppress the immune system leading to an
immunodeficiency state. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the pathogen that
cause Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) escapes and attacks the immune
system of man. The HIV causes progressive destruction of immune responses in the
person leading to frequent infections and increased susceptibility to certain cancers
which can cause death.","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
67,Animal Form and Function,Osmoregulation and excretion,"Osmoregulation is processes by which organisms control solute concentrations
and water balance within the body. Simple unicellular organisms such as Amoeba,
Paramecium etc. use contractile vacuoles for osmoregulation. But animals have
developed different structures for osmoregulation. The chemical reactions that occur
in organisms result in the formation of waste products, often toxic, which must be
disposed in some way. The removal of the nitrogenous metabolite and other metabolic
waste products from the body is called excretion. Defecation is not considered under
excretion as it involves the removal of undigested food from the gut. In many animals
excretory and osomoregulatory systems are linked structurally and functionally.
Importance and need of osmoregulation and excretion
For effective body functioning and survival animals have to maintain a constant
internal environment specially the relative concentrations of water and solutes within
favorable limits. Therefore animals need to regulate the chemical composition of body
fluids by balancing uptake and loss of water and solutes. Animal cells will swell and
burst if water uptake is excessive. On the other hand, animal cells will shrink and die
if water loss is high. The driving force of loss of water in animals as in plants is the
concentration gradient of solutes across the cell membrane. Animals have evolved
different osmoregulatory strategies depending on the environment in which they live
for their survival.
Animals have to get rid of toxic products produced during metabolism in order to
safeguard the composition of their internal environment. Otherwise these excretory
end products become toxic to the body cells. For example protein and nucleic acids are
broken down within the body cell during metabolism and the amine group is converted
to ammonia which is highly toxic. Ammonia also acts as a weak base. Oxidation of
glucose during metabolism will release CO2 which is a weak acid. Accumulation of
such weak acids and bases will alter the acid base balance in the internal environment.
Changes in acid base balance will lead to adverse effects such as denaturation of
proteins. Therefore removal of excretory products from the body is essential to maintain
the internal environment within favorable limits for effective body functioning and
survival.
Relationship between metabolic substrates and excretory products
Metabolic substrates in the cells are carbohydrates, fats, proteins and nucleic acids.
The excretory products of these substrates will vary depending on several factors
such as the chemical structure and the composition, availability of enzymes, oxygen
availability and the habitat in which they live. 

When carbohydrates are metabolized within the body cells when oxygen is available
final excretory end products are CO2 and water. If they are subjected to anaerobic
respiration in general lactic acid is produced.
When fats are subjected to aerobic metabolism final excretory products are CO2 and
water. Since proteins contain amine groups in their structure, during metabolism of
excess amino acids ammonia is produced. Since nucleic acids contain nitrogenous bases
ammonia is produced as an excretory product during their metabolism. Depending on
the habitat and the availability of enzymes ammonia will be further converted to other
nitrogenous waste products such as urea and uric acid.
Relationship between the nitrogenous excretory products and living
environment
Nitrogenous excretory products of animals are ammonia, uric acid and urea. These
different forms vary significantly in their toxicity and the energy costs of producing
them.
Since ammonia is highly toxic, a large volume of water is needed to excrete ammonia.
Therefore typically the organisms that live in water such as bony fishes, many aquatic
invertebrates and aquatic amphibians specially tadpoles excrete ammonia since they
have ready access to water. Energy cost for producing ammonia for excretion is
comparatively low.
Terrestrial animals do not have access to sufficient water to excrete ammonia as the
main excretory product. Instead most terrestrial animals such as mammals and adult
amphibians mainly excrete urea as the main nitrogenous excretory product. Urea is
less toxic. However animals must expend more energy to produce urea from ammonia.
Some marine fishes such as sharks also excrete urea (which they use for osmoregulation)
as the main nitrogenous waste.
Some terrestrial animals such as birds, many reptiles, land snails and insects excrete
uric acid as the main excretory product. Uric acid is relatively non-toxic and generally
insoluble in water Therefore it is excreted as a semisolid with trace amount of water.
However uric acid production from ammonia requires more energy than urea production
.
The diversity of excretory structures of animals (Fine structures are not necessary )
Body Surface - The cells of some animals which are in direct contact with the
environment and eliminate excretory products by diffusion. e.g. cnidarians 

Flame cells- These are specialized excretory cells connected to a network of tubule
which opens to the outside of the animal. E.g. flatworms. 
Nephridia – They are multi cellular, tubular structures. One end of the tubule is open
to the coelom while the other end opens to the outside. e.g. Annelids 
Malpighian tubules – These are extensive blind end tubules immersed in hemolymph
and opens in to the digestive tract. e.g.: Insects and other terrestrial arthropods 

Malpighian tubules – These are extensive blind end tubules immersed in hemolymph
and opens in to the digestive tract. e.g.: Insects and other terrestrial arthropods 

Green glands / Antennal glands –Two large glands found ventrally in the head and
anterior to the oesophagus. e.g. Crustaceans
Sweat glands –There are coiled tubular glands situated in the dermis and connected to
a sweat duct which open as a pore on the surface of the skin. E.g. human skin.
Salt glands –They are paired glands found near the eyes to excrete excess salts. e.g.
Marine birds and marine reptiles.
Kidney – These are the major excretory and osmoregulatory organs of all vertebrates.
Human Urinary System
Human urinary system consists of two kidneys, two ureters, urinary bladder and
urethra 

summary of the main functions of the parts involved in the urinary system:
•	Kidney: Produces urine to excrete waste products, while maintaining osmotic balance and acid-base balance.
•	Ureter: Transports urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder.
•	Urinary Bladder: Provides temporary storage for urine.
•	Urethra: Acts as the passage through which urine stored in the bladder is expelled from the body.

Location of kidneys
Two kidneys are located on the posterior abdominal wall one on either side of the
vertebral column, behind the peritoneum and below the diaphragm. Right kidney is
slightly lower than the left.
Blood supply
The kidneys receive blood from aorta via the renal arteries and renal veins return blood
to the inferior vena cava.
Gross structure of the kidney
Kidney is a bean shaped organ which is held in position by a mass of fat and both are
surrounded by a fibrous connective tissue. In the longitudinal section of the kidney
three areas of tissues can be seen to the naked eye. They are outer fibrous capsule,
renal cortex and inner renal medulla. Cortex and medulla are supplied with blood
vessels and tightly packed with excretory tubules. Renal Cortex is granulated due to
the presence of glomeruli. Medulla is composed of renal pyramids, which have striated
appearance. Apices of pyramids project in to the renal pelvis through renal papillae.
Renal pelvis leads into the ureter. Renal artery and renal vein pass through the pelvis. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
68,Animal Form and Function,Structure of Nephron,"Nephron is the structural and functional unit of the kidney. There are over millions of
nephrons in each kidney. There are two types of nephrons; they are cortical nephrons
(reach short distance to the medulla) and juxta medullary nephrons (extend deep into
the medulla).
Majority of the nephrons are cortical nephrons 

A nephron consists of a single long tubule and a ball of capillaries called the glomerulus.
The tubule is closed at one end forming Bowman’s capsule which surrounds the
glomerulus. The other end of the tubule joins with the collecting duct.
Tubule consists of;
• Bowman’s capsule
• Proximal convoluted tubule
• Loop of Henle
• Distal convoluted tubule 

Bowman’s capsule (Glomerular capsule)
This is expanded and closed end of the tubular structure of the nephron. It is a cup
shaped and double walled structure. Inner layer of Bowman’s capsule consists of a
single layer of flattened epithelial cells specialized for filtration. Outer layer of the
Bowman’s capsule composed of simple squamous epithelium. Space between the
inner and outer layers is known as capsular space which is responsible for receiving of
glomerular filtrate. The glomerular filtrate pass through three major tubular regions of
the nephron: proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule. 

Glomerulus
The glomerulus is a ball of capillaries which is surrounded by Bowman’s capsule. The
nephron is supplied with blood from the afferent arteriole. The blood vessel leaving
away from the glomerulus is the efferent arteriole. The efferent arteriole has a smaller
diameter than the afferent arteriole. This modification is important for increasing blood
pressure in the glomerulus for ultrafiltration.
The efferent arteriole form two capillary networks, one form the peritubular capillaries
which surrounds the proximal and distal convoluted tubules and the other network
form the vasa recta which extend towards the medulla surrounding the loop of Henle. 

Proximal convoluted tubule
It is comparatively longer and wider than the distal convoluted tubule. This is lined by
simple epithelium which has been specialized for selective reabsorption of substances(
nutrients, ions and water) from the glomerular filtrate
•	
Loop of Henle
It is a ‘U’ shaped part of the nephron with descending limb and ascending limb which
are lined by simple epithelium.
Lining of the descending limb of loop of Henle is specialized for water reabsorption as
it allows free movement of water. But lining of the ascending limb of loop of Henle is
impermeable to water. 
Distal convoluted tubule
It is lined by simple epitheliam which has been specialized for selective reabsorption
of specific ions and water. It leads into collecting duct. 



Main steps in urine formation
There are 3 processes involved in urine formation. They are;
• ultrafi ltration
• selective reabsorption
• secretion
Ultra fi ltration
• Filtration of the blood under high pressure into the cavity of the Bowmans’
capsule is called ultrafiltration.
• Filtration occurs through the capillary walls of glomerulus and inner wall of
Bowman’s capsule.
• Blood capillaries of glomerulus are porous and cells lining the Bowmans’
capsule are specialized for filtration of small size molecules and ions. These
specializations allow passage of water and small solutes through the blood
capillary walls into the Bowman’s capsule. But due to their large size, blood
cells, platelets and large molecules such as plasma proteins do not pass into the
Bowmans’ capsule.
• The filtrate in the Bowmans’ capsule contains salts, amino acids, glucose,
vitamins, nitrogenous wastes and other small molecules. The composition of the
glomerular filtrate is similar in composition to plasma with exceptions of blood
cells, platelets and plasma proteins.
Selective reabsorption
• The process through which useful molecules, ions and water from the glomerular
filtrate are recovered and returned to the interstitial fluid and then into capillary
network of the tubules is called selective reabsorption.
• Most of the reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate back into the blood takes
place in the convoluted tubule. Ions, water and valuable nutrients are reabsorbed
either active or passive transport from initial filtrate.
Secretion
• The process by which foreign materials and substances not required to the body
including waste are cleared from the peritubular capillaries and interstitial fluid
into the filtrate is called secretion 
• Secretion is required because such substances may not be entirely filtered due to
the short time they remain in the glomerulus.
• Substances that are secreted in to the filtrate include H+, NH3, creatinine, drugs
(e.g. penicillin, aspirin) and excess K+. Tubular secretion of H+ and NH3 are
important to maintain the normal pH in the blood by formation of NH4+ in the
urine. NH
3 can combine with H+ to form NH4+
• Secretion occurs in the proximal and distal convoluted tubules. Secretion may be
either active or passive depending on the location and / or the substance. ","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
69,Animal Form and Function,Process of urine formation,"Glomerular filtrate in the Bowmans’ capsule which contains all the substances in the
blood except blood cells, platelets and large molecules pass to the proximal convoluted
tubule. At this region selective reabsorption of ions, water and valuable nutrients from
the initial filtrate occurs. Nutrients especially glucose and amino acids are actively
transported to the interstitial fluid. Cells lining the tubule actively transport Na+ into
the interstitial fluid and this transfer a positive charge out of the tubule drives the
passive transport of Cl-. Proximal tubule also reabsorbs K+ and most of the HCO3- by
passive transport. Reabsorption of HCO3- in the filtrate contributes to the pH balance
in body fluids. As solutes move from the filtrate to interstitial fluid water is reabsorbed
passively by osmosis. A major portion of water reabsorption from the filtrate occurs
at this site. As the filtrate pass through the proximal convoluted tubule, secretion of
specific substances into the filtrate takes place. Cells lining the tubule secrete H+ (by
active transport) and ammonia (by passive transport) into the lumen of the tubule.
Secreted ammonia act as a buffer to trap H+ forming NH4+. In addition some materials
such as drugs and toxins that have been metabolized in the liver are actively secreted
into the lumen of the proximal convoluted tubule. As a result of water reabsorption and
secretion of different substances, the filtrate becomes more concentrated as it passes
through the proximal convoluted tubule.
As the filtrate moves into the descending limb of loop of Henle passive reabsorption of
water through osmosis continues and filtrate becomes more concentrated. The filtrate
reaches the ascending limb of the loop of Henle via the tip of the loop. Ascending limb
is impermeable to water so that no water absorption takes place but a considerable
amount of NaCl reabsorption occurs at this site. Most of the Na+ is transported into the
interstitial fluid by active transport. As a result of losing NaCl but not water the filtrate
become more diluted as it moves towards the distal convoluted tubule.
The distal convoluted tubule plays an important role in regulating K+ and NaCl
concentration of body fluids. The amount of K+ secreted (by active transport) into the
filtrate and the amount of NaCl (by active transport) reabsorbed from the filtrate can
be varied at this site according to the needs of the body. Distal tubule also contributes 
to pH regulation by controlled secretion of H+ and reabsorption of HCO3-. At the distal
convoluted tubule passive water reabsorption can be increased under the influence of
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) to form concentrated urine. Aldesterone secreted by the
adrenal gland stimulates increase reabsorption of Na+ and water and excretion of K+ .
This filtrate of the distal convoluted tubule finally leads to the collecting duct.
As the filtrate pass along the collecting duct filtrate become concentrated and urine is
formed. At this site water reabsorption can also be increased under the influence of
ADH and urine become more concentrated. Aldesterone hormone stimulates active
reabsorption of Na+ and passive reabsorption of water at the collecting duct. Because
of the high urea concentration in the filtrate at this region some urea diffuses into the
interstitial fluid. Final processing of the filtrate at the collecting duct forms the urine.
When producing dilute urine the kidney actively reabsorb salts without allowing water
to be reabsorbed by osmosis. 

Role of kidney in homeostasis
• Maintaining electrolyte and water balance in the body fluids (osmoregulation).
• Excretion of toxic waste products from the body.
• Regulating blood pH through acid base balance.
• Controlling blood volume and blood pressure.
• Secretion of erythropoeitein hormone that stimulates red blood cell production.
• Production and Secretion of renin an enzyme important in control of blood
pressure.
Disorders related to human urinary system
Bladder and kidney stones
These are formed due to precipitation of urinary constituents (usually oxalates and
phosphates) normally in urine. They are also called renal calculi.
Causes include
• Dehydration due to not drinking sufficient amount of fluids.
• Alkaline nature of urine.
• Infections that can alter pH of urine
• Metabolic condition.
• Family history.
Measures for prevention
• Drinking plenty of water
Kidney failure
This is due to the inability of the kidneys to function properly. Therefore waste products
and excess fluid will be accumulated in the blood.
Reasons for kidney failure
• Diabetes
• High blood pressure
• Having family history
• Getting older
Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
It is a condition of gradual loss of kidney function over time. There are many reasons
for Kidney failure:
• Diabetes
• High blood pressure 
• Having family history
• Getting older
Prevent CKD
Follow a low salt, low fat diet
Doing proper exercise
Having regular check ups
Prevent smoking
Dialysis
Dialysis is done for the patients with kidney failure. It is a process of removing
excretory products, excess solutes and toxins from the blood by an artificial method.
Chronic kidney disease of unknown/uncertain etiology (CKDu) in Sri Lanka
• It is a condition of gradual loss of kidney function over time. The root cause of
CKDu has not been definitively established yet – hence it is referred to as ‘Chronic
kidney disease of unknown/uncertain etiology’. However it is a different form
of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is associated with conventional risk
factors such as diabetes and high blood pressure, genetic disorders and urinary
tract problems
•
• The onset of the disease appears to be asymptomatic, and by the time the patient
seeks treatment the kidneys have reached a stage of irreversible damage -end
stage renal disease (ESRD).
• In Sri Lanka, initially CKDu was prevalent among rural communities in North
Central province (Medawachchiya, Kabithigollawa, Padaviya, Medirigiriya,
regions), Uva (Girandurukotte), Eastern Provinces (Dehiattakandiya). CKDu is
also reported in North Western, Southern and Central provinces, and parts of the
Northern Province of the island.
Hypothesized reasons for CKDu
Cause of CKDu seems to be multifactorial.
• Exposure to Heavy metal/ metaloid such as Arsenic (As) and Cadmium (Cd)
through food and water.
• Usage of low quality utensils for preparation of foods.
• High Flouride (F) levels in water.
• Exposure to pesticides.
• Genetic factors.
• Malnutrition and dehydration","Biology, Grade 12, Resource Book"
70,Animal Form and Function - II,Processes and systems involved incoordination  ,"Coordination between stimuli and responses is needed to maintain constant internal environment
inside the body of an organism for existence.
Systems contributing to coordination
Animals unlike plants have two different but related systems for coordination of body function.
They are the nervous system and the endocrine system. 

Similarities and differences (in relation to coordination) of the nervous system and
endocrine system 

Nervous coordination and hormonal coordination are two distinct systems that regulate the body's functions. Nervous coordination transmits signals through neurons, utilizing both chemical and electrical impulses, leading to rapid and localized responses. In contrast, hormonal coordination relies on chemicals (hormones) transported through the bloodstream, resulting in more diffuse and slower-acting effects. While nervous coordination initiates fast responses that are typically short in duration, hormonal coordination produces longer-lasting effects but takes more time to start. Both systems work together to maintain the body's overall balance and functionality.

Organization of nervous systems in different animals Phyla
Animals have specialized systems of neurons to sense their surroundings and respond rapidly.

In the animal kingdom, cnidarians are the simplest animals having a nervous system. They have
a diffuse nerve net which is composed of interconnected individual neurons.
In more complex animals, the nervous systems contain groups of neurons organized into
nerves, and often ganglia and a 'brain'. In some platyhelminthes such as Planaria, the nervous
system contains a pair of ganglia in the anterior region (‘brain’) and a pair of longitudinal nerve
cords. In planarians, the eye spots which are located near the ganglia act as photoreceptors.
Annelids and arthropods have somewhat complicated brains and ventral nerve cords.
The ventral nerve cord contains ganglia. They are segmentally arranged. The nervous system of echinodermates is composed of radial nerves and a nerve ring. The nervous system of the chordates
consists of a central nervous system (CNS) and a peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS
is composed of the brain and the spinal cord. The PNS is composed of nerves and ganglia. 

Different organism phyla and their nervous organization

In various phyla, the nervous system exhibits different levels of organization. In Cnidaria, a simple nerve net is present, as seen in Hydra. The Platyhelminthes phylum, such as Planaria, has a brain and longitudinal nerve cords, providing a more centralized form of control. Annelida, exemplified by the Leech, features a brain, a ventral nerve cord, and segmental ganglia, which help coordinate movement in segmented bodies. Arthropoda, like the Cockroach, also possesses a brain and ventral nerve cord, along with segmental ganglia for efficient body coordination. Echinodermata, such as the Sea star, have a nerve ring and radial nerves that help manage their radial symmetry. Finally, in Chordata, represented by the Gecko, the nervous system is highly developed, consisting of a brain and a dorsal nerve cord (spinal cord), facilitating complex motor and sensory functions.



The gross structure and the functions of the human nervous system
Organization and main parts of the human nervous system
Human nervous system consists of central and peripheral nervous systems. In vertebrates, the
brain and the spinal cord form the central nervous system. Nerves and ganglia form the main
components of the peripheral nervous system. 

The human nervous system is divided into two main components: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
1.	Central Nervous System (CNS): This includes the brain and spinal cord. The CNS is responsible for processing information and sending out instructions to the body, acting as the control center for all functions.
2.	Peripheral Nervous System (PNS): The PNS consists of all the nerves outside the CNS, which connect the CNS to the rest of the body. It is further divided into three parts:
a.	Cranial nerves, which originate from the brain.
b.	Spinal nerves, which arise from the spinal cord.
c.	Ganglia outside CNS, which are clusters of nerve cell bodies that help relay signals between the CNS and peripheral nerves.
Together, these systems ensure the coordination of the body’s sensory inputs and motor responses.","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
71,Animal Form and Function - II,Central nervous system (CNS),"Central nervous system consists of the brain and the spinal cord. In vertebrates, the CNS develops
from the hollow dorsal nerve cord during embryonic development. The anterior part of the central
nervous system enlarges and forms the brain which has three major regions: forebrain, midbrain
and hindbrain. The central canal in the brain forms four irregularly shaped cavities called ventricles.
The brain contains four ventricles: three ventricles are present in the fore brain and one ventricle
is in the hind brain. This central canal continues in the spinal cord. The ventricles and central
canal contain cerebrospinal fluid. This fluid helps to maintain uniform pressure within the CNS
and acts as a shock absorber between the brain and skull. It also helps to circulate nutrients and
hormones as well as to remove waste products.
The brain and the spinal cord have several adaptations to be protected from physical injuries.
The brain is enclosed by a skull. The spinal cord is surrounded by vertebrae which forms the
vertebral column. Further protection to the CNS is given by three layers of tissues called the
meninges. The outermost layer is called the dura mater, the innermost layer as pia mater and in
between these two layers is the arachnoid mater.
Main parts of the human Brain
The forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain of the human embryo develop into the adult brain. The
forebrain gives rise to the cerebrum, thalamus, hypothalamus and pineal body. The mid brain
gives rise to part of the brain stem. The hind brain gives rise to cerebellum, pons Varolii and
medulla oblongata. The brain stem consists of the midbrain, pons Varolii and medulla oblongata. Cerebrum
Cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain. It is divided by a deep cleft into right and left
cerebral hemispheres. The superficial part of the cerebrum is composed of nerve cell bodies
(or grey matter) forming the cerebral cortex and deeper layers consist of nerve fibers (or white
matter). The two cerebral hemispheres are connected by corpus callosum which is a mass of white
matter. The cerebral cortex shows many infoldings to increase the surface area of the cerebrum.
The cortex of each cerebral hemisphere is divided into four lobes: frontal lobe, temporal lobe,
parietal lobe and occipital lobe. 
Three main functional areas o1’the cerebral cortex has been identified. They are;
• Sensory areas which receive and process sensory information including the perception of’
pain, temperature. touch, sight, hearing, taste and smell
• Association areas which are responsible for recognition and interpretation of sensory
information and integration and processing of complex mental functions such as memory,
intelligence, reasoning, judgment and emotions
• Motor areas which are responsible for directing skeletal (voluntary) muscle movement
through the initiation and control of voluntary muscle contraction 

Thalamus
Thalamus is situated within the cerebral hemispheres just below the corpus callosum. It consists
of two masses comprising grey and white matter.
Functions:
Thalamus acts as the main input center of sensory information from special sense organs and
sensory receptors in the skin and internal organs. This sensory information is sorted and directed
to specific location of the cerebral cortex for further processing and perception. The thalamus
relays and redistributes nerve impulses from most parts of the brain to cerebral cortex.
Hypothalamus
Hypothalamus is situated below and in front of the thalamus, immediately above the pituitary
gland. It is linked to the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland by nerve fibers and to the anterior
lobe by a complex system of blood vessels.
Functions:
• Regulates body temperature
• Regulates thirst and water balance
• Regulates appetite
• Regulate sleep and wake cycles
• Control of autonomic nervous system
• Initiates fight-or-flight response
• Sourceforposteriorpituitaryhormonesandreleasinghormonesthatacton anterior pituitary.
• Plays role in sexual behaviors
Mid brain
Mid brain is the upperpart of the brain stem. It is situated between the cerebrum (above) and the
PonsVarolii (below) surrounding the cerebrospinal fluid filled connection of the third and fourth
ventricles. The mid brain contains aggregates of nerve cell bodies and nerve tracts which connect the
cerebrum with the lower brain and spinal cord.
Functions:
• Acts as relay stations for ascending and descending nerve fibers
• Receives and integrates sensory information (auditory and visual) and sends it to particular
regions of the forebrain,.
• Coordinates auditory and visual reflexes
PonsVarolii
PonsVarolii,(a part of the brainstem) is located in front of the cerebellum, below the mid brain
and above them edullaoblongata. It contains nerve fibers that form bridges between thetwo
hemispheres of the cerebellum. It also contains nerve fibers passing between higher levels of
 the brain and spinal cord. Groups of nerve cell bodies in the Pons Varolii form centers that regulate
respiration. Some nerve cell bodies in the pons act as relay stations.
Functions:
•	Transfers information between PNS and the midbrain and forebrain
•	Coordinates large scale body movements such as climbing and running
•	Together with the medulla oblongata, it helps regulate respiration.
•	
Medulla oblongata
 Medulla oblongata is the lowest part of the brain stem which extends from the Pons Varolii above
and is continuous with the spinal cord below. It consists of cardiovascular centre, respiratory
center and reflex centers.
Functions:
•	Transfers information between PNS and the mid brain and the fore brain
•	Coordinates large scale body movements such as running, climbing
•	Controls several autonomic, homeostatic functions including breathing, heart and blood
vessel activities (contains respiratory center, cardiovascular center)
•	Controls involuntary reflexes such as vomiting, swallowing, coughing, sneezing through
reflex centers

Cerebellum

Cerebellum is located behind the pons Varolii and below the posterior portion of the cerebrum. It
is also made up of two hemispheres.
Functions
•	Coordinates voluntary muscular movements
•	Maintains posture and balance
•	Helps in learning and remembering motor skill 
Spinal cord
The spinal cord is an elongated cylindrical structure suspended in the vertebral canal. It is
continuous with the medulla oblongata. Centre of the spinal cord contains the central canal which
is surrounded by grey matter. The outer region of the spinal cord is made up of white matter.
Functions:
•	 Links the central nervous systems to sensory and motor neurons and facilitates nerve
impulse propagation towards the brain and away the brain
•	 Coordinates and produces reflexes","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
72,Animal Form and Function - II,Peripheral nervous system (PNS),"Peripheral nervous system is made up of cranial nerves, spinal nerves and autonomic nervous
system (with ganglia). It transmits impulses to and from CNS regulating both an animal’s
movement and its internal environment. 

Sensory information from sensory receptors reaches the CNS along PNS neurons referred to as
afferent neurons (sensory neurons). Within the CNS this information is processed, and instructions
are transmitted to effector tissues/organs (muscles, glands and endocrine cells) along PNS neurons
referred to as efferent neurons (motor neurons).
PNS consists of two efferent components;
e The motor system- It consists of neurons that carry nerve impulses to skeletal muscles. So
it controls voluntary activities.
e Autonomic nervous system- It generally controls the involuntary activities of the body.
Autonomic nervous system consists of neurons which carry impulses to control activities
of smooth muscles, cardiac muscles and glands.
Autonomic nervous system consists mainly of two divisions:
e Sympathetic division
e Parasympathetic division
Sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system
The majority of the body organs are supplied by both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves
which have antagonistic (opposite) functions. Sympathetic stimulations prepare the body to
deal with exciting/ stressful situations and energy generating situations (fight- or -flight).
Parasympathetic division causes opposite responses that promote calming or a return to self-maintenance functions (rest and stimulate digestion and food absorption).
The two divisions differ in overall functions, organization and the signal released. Parasympathetic
nerves exit the CNS at the base of the brain or the spinal cord as cranial nerves or spinal nerves
respectively. On the other hand, sympathetic nerves exist only from the spinal cord. Different
neurotransmitters enable the two systems to bring about two opposite effects in different organs
such as lung, heart, intestine and bladder. For example, when the neurotransmitter secreted by
the parasympathetic division is acetylcholine, the sympathetic division secretes norepinephrine. 

How nerve impulses are generated and transmitted 

In all cells including neurons, ions are distributed unequally between the cell interior and exterior
(extra cellular fluid). Generally, the inside of the cell is negatively charged whereas the exterior
is positively charged. Opposite charges are attracted across the plasma membrane and as a
result it creates a voltage difference across the membrane that is referred to as membrane potential.
Resting potential
When a neuron is at rest (when not sending a signal/non conducting), the membrane potential
(voltage difference across the membrane) is called the resting potential. In a non-conducting
neuron the resting potential is typically between -60 mV and -80 mV. 

The resting membrane potential is maintained by;
e Distribution of ion concentrations inside and outside of the neuron. In a non conducting
neuron the concentration of K* is higher inside the cell while concentration of Na’ is higher
outside. There are large anions (proteins) inside the cell in addition to some CI ions. As
a result, a neuron has a negative charge inside the cell and positive charge outside the cell.
e Selective permeability of the plasma membrane to K* and Na* ions. There are leaky
potassium channels and sodium channels, which are membrane bound proteins. Potassium
channels allow only K* ions to pass whereas sodium channels allow only Na’ to pass.
These channels are leaky and allow K* and NATO diffuse according to their concentration
gradient. However, there are more leaky potassium channels open than sodium channels
These Potassium channels allow net outflow of Potassium due to chemical concentration
gradient. However, Sodium ions and other ions cannot readily cross the membrane. As a
result there is a net negative charge inside the cell.
e Sodium-potassium pump- This pump helps to maintain Na* and K* gradient across the
membrane by transporting three Na* out of the cell for every two K* that it transports in.
This pump uses ATP to actively transport these ions.
Action potential
An action potential occurs due to a change in membrane potential above a certain value
(threshold value) due to a stimulus. The action potential has the following phases: depolarization,
repolarization and hyperpolarization.
Depolarization: A change in the cell’s membrane potential such that the inside of the membrane
is made less negative relative to the outside. Depolarization results due to Na * inflow from the
Sodium channels bound to plasma membrane in response to a stimulus.
Repolarization: Sodium channels close blocking Na inflow. However, most potassium channels
open permitting K* outflow. This makes the inside of the cell negative.
Hyperpolarization: Sodium channels are closed but potassium channels are opened. As a result

the inside of the membrane is more negative.
Refractory period
Refractory period is the short time immediately after an action potential in which the neuron
cannot respond to another stimulus, owing to the inactivation of sodium channels. This prevents
the reverse conduction of an impulse in an axon. 
Conduction of action potential (nerve impulse)
•	 A series of action potentials that move along an axon is defined as a nerve impulse.
•	 An action potential is generated due to Nanoflow (depolarization) at one location in the
axon.
•	 This axon potential spreads to the neighboring location while the initial location repolarizes.
•	This depolarization-repolarization process is repeated through the axon.

The speed of conduction depends on:
•	 Diameter of the axon- The conduction speed increases with the increase in axon diameter.
•	 Presence of myelinated axon (in myelinated neuron, axon potential jumps from one node
of Ranvier to the next)

Synapses
A synapse is the junction where a neuron (presynaptic cell) communicates with another cell
(postsynaptic cell) across a narrow gap (synaptic cleft). Postsynaptic cells may be another neuron,
muscle cells or secretory cells. This junction where one neuron communicates with the next
cell using a chemical (neurotransmitter) is called a chemical synapse. Some neurons can also
communicate through direct electrical connections (electrical synapse). ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
73,Animal Form and Function - II,Mechanism of transmission of nerve impulses through chemical synapses,"•	An action potential at an axon terminal depolarizes the plasma membrane of presynaptic
cell
•	Depolarization at the presynaptic terminal causes Ca” to diffuse into the terminals.
•	The rise in Ca” causes binding of synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters to the
presynaptic membrane.
•	This results in the release of the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.
•	Neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft.
•	 Neurotransmitters bind and activate specific receptors in the postsynaptic cell membrane.
•	
e If acetylcholine is taken for example of a neurotransmitter, the binding of neurotransmitters
to the post synaptic membrane allows Na+ and K’ to diffuse across the post synaptic
membrane.
•	 Depolarization takes place in the post synaptic membrane, and it reaches the action potential
•	 After passing the nerve impulse to the postsynaptic cell, the signal at the presynaptic
terminals is terminated either by:
 Enzymatic hydrolysis of neurotransmitter, Recapture of neurotransmitter into the presynaptic terminals.

Neurotransmitters
Neurotransmitters are the molecules that are released from the synaptic terminals of presynaptic
neuron and diffuse across the synaptic cleft, bind to the receptors at the postsynaptic membrane,
triggering a response.
Common neurotransmitters are; 
•	Acetylcholine
•	 Some amino acids
•	 Biogenic amines
•	 Neuropeptides
•	Some gases 

Reflex arc
Reflex arcs are the functional unit of the vertebrate nervous system. Typically, a reflex arc consists
of three neurons. They are
1. Afferent/ Sensory neuron
2. Interneuron
3. Efferent/ Motor neuron
A sensory neuron transmits impulses from a sensory receptor to the central nervous system where
it synapses with an associated neuron called interneuron. This impulse is transmitted to a motor
neuron. The motor neuron conveys the signal to effector tissues/organs.

Common disorders of the nervous system

Common disorders of the nervous system are Schizophrenia, Depression, Alzheimer’s disease
and Parkinson’s disease.
•	Schizophrenia: This is a severe mental disturbance characterized by psychotic episodes
in which patients have a distorted perception of reality. They experience voices that only
they can hear. They think that others are plotting to harm them. Evidence suggests that this
disorder affects neural pathways that use dopamine as a neurotransmitter.
•	Depression: Depression is likely to be due to a complex combination of factors that
include: Changes in neurotransmitter levels in the brain, genetics, psychological, social,
environmental factors. People who are suffering from this disorder show depressed mood,
abnormalities in sleep, appetite and energy level. In some conditions, once enjoyable
activities are no longer pleasurable or interesting. Some conditions involve extreme mood
swings. Effective therapies are available to increase activity of some neurotransmitters in
the brain
•	 Alzheimer’s disease: This is a severe mental deterioration (dementia) characterized by
confusion and memory loss. Patients are gradually becoming less able to dress, bathe and
feed themselves. They lose their ability to recognize people, including their immediate
family members. The cause of the disease is due to progressive and irreversible degeneration
of neurons in the brain, especially in cerebral cortex with deteriorating mental functioning.
The disease affects elderly people. Genetic factors may be involved. So far, there is no
cure for this disease. 
•	Parkinson disease: This is a progressive motor disorder that leads to lack of control and
coordination of muscle movements. The patients show slowness of movements, difficulty
initiating movements, poor balance; fixed muscle tone causing lack of facial expression;
speech problems and muscle tremor of extremities: e.g. shaking a hand, fingers in one
hand, shaking head. This disease is associated with gradual degeneration of dopamine
neurotransmitter releasing neurons in the brain (mid brain, basal ganglia). The disease is
common in the elderly people. Genetic factors may be involved. Disease can be treated but
not cured. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
74,Animal Form and Function - II,Human sensory structures and functions,"A sensory receptor is a specialized structure which can detect a specific stimulus and convert
the stimulus energy to a changing membrane potential to be transmitted to the central nervous
system as action potentials for sensory perception and interpretation. Sensory receptor can be a
specialized cell or an organ or a subcellular structure that could detect the stimuli. Some sensory
cells are specialized neurons. Sensory receptors can inform the central nervous system about
the conditions inside and outside the body in order to maintain homeostasis. Specific sensory
receptors detect the stimuli that arise in the external environment whereas internal receptors sense
the stimuli that arise inside the body.
Basic characteristic of sensory receptors.
•	A specialized structure (cell / organ / subcellular structure) designed to receive a specific
stimuli.
•	Detect the stimulus if the stimulus is at or above threshold level.
•	Convert the energy of the stimulus (e.g. light energy, sound energy) into a changing
membrane potential to be later transmitted as an action potential.
•	Always connected with the nervous system.
•	During the conversion of stimulus energy into the action potential, sensory signal can be
strengthened which is called amplification.
•	If the stimulation is continuous, many receptors show decrease in responsiveness which
is called sensory adaptation (For example upon continuous exposure to a strong smell,
perception of that smell gradually decreases and stops within few minutes).
•	
Types of sensory receptors
Sensory receptors can be categorized based on the nature of the stimulus they detect. Several types
of sensory receptors are found in the human body. They are chemoreceptors, thermoreceptors,
photoreceptors, mechanoreceptors and pain receptors. 


•	Chemoreceptors

These are sensory receptors that respond to chemical stimuli. Chemical substances should
always be dissolved in water to stimulate sensory cells. Chemoreceptors include taste
receptors and olfactory receptors. These receptors mediate the senses of taste and sinell.
Some chemoreceptors can detect specific chemicalssuchasCO2
in the circulating blood.

• Tast ereceptors: Five basics enations of taste have been end escribed: sweet, sour, bitter, salt
and umami (Savory taste). Receptor cells for taste are modified epithelial cells organized
into taste buds. Tastebuds are found in papillae which are small projections of the tongue.
A taste bud consists of taste cells, supporting cells and sensory nerve endings. Substances
to be tasted should be dissolved in the fluid surrounding the sensory cells and diffuse to
receptor cells.
•	Olfactory receptors: In olfaction, receptor cells are neurons. Olfactory receptor cells are
located within the epithelium of the upper portion of the nasal cavity. Receptive ends of
the cells extend into the mucus layer of the nasal cavity. When odorants diffuse into this
region, receptor cells are stimulated, and the nerve impulse is sent along their axons to them.
olfactory bulb in the brain. 

 
•	Thermoreceptors
Thermoreceptors are specialized temperature sensitive receptors which detect heat and cold
on the body surface and in the internal environment of the body. Thermoreceptors located in
the skin detect the body surface temperature whereas thermoreceptors found in hypothalamus
detects the temperature of the blood circulating through the internal organs (core temperature).
Thermoreceptors found in the skin a rare Rause end bulbs (detect cold), Ruffini corpuscles (detect
warmth) and free nerve endings (detect both cold and warmth). Thermoreceptors found in the
hypothalamus are specialized neurons.

•	 Photoreceptors
Photoreceptors are sensitive to light. Humans have two main types of photoreceptor cells called
rods and cones.
•	Rods: They are more sensitive to light but do not distinguish colours, they enable us to see
at night but only in black and white.
•	Cones: They provide color vision. But they contribute very little to night vision as they
are not very sensitive. There are three types of cones. Each has a different sensitivity
across the visible spectrum providing an optimal response to red, green, or blue light.

•	Mechanoreceptors

Mechanoreceptors respond to stimuli arising from mechanical energy deformation such as
pressure, touch, stretch, motion and sound. Mechanoreceptors in the human body include the
following.
•	Touch receptors: They are mostly present close to the surface of the skin. Examples for
touch receptors are Meissner corpuscles (sensitive to light pressure), Merkel discs (sensitive
to light touch) and free nerve endings.
•	 Pressure receptors: Example for pressure receptors are Pacinian corpuscles which are
present in the deep skin. They are sensitive to deep pressure.
•	Vibration receptors: Most of the touch receptors can also detect vibrations (e.g. Meissner
corpuscles, Pacinian corpuscles). Specific hair cells in the organ of Corti in the inner ear
detect sound vibrations. Hair cells of the vestibule of the inner ear detect gravity whereas
hair cells of the semicircular canals detect motion.
•	Pain receptors

Pain receptors detect stimuli that reflect harmful conditions that could arise from extreme
pressure or temperature and certain chemicals that could damage the tissues. Special
nerve endings in different parts of the body can detect tissue damage. Ultimately the
pain is perceived by the brain. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
75,Animal Form and Function - II,Basic structure and functions of the human eye,"the eye is the organ responsible for sight. There is a fine transparent membrane that lines the
iris and front of the eyeball; this is called conjunctiva. The walls of the eye are made up of three
layers of tissue: The outer fibrous layer (sclera and cornea), the middle vascular layer (choroid, ciliary body and iris) and the inner nervous layer (Retina). Inside the eyeball contains the lens,
aqueous fluid and vitreous body.
Sclera and cornea
•	Sclera is white and opaque. It is the outermost layer of the posterior and lateral aspects of
the eyeball. It connects anteriorly with the clear transparent epithelial membrane called
cornea. Sclera maintains the shape of the eye and gives attachment of the extrinsic muscles
of the eye.
•	Cornea is the passage through which light rays reach the retina. It is devoid of blood
vessels. The cornea is convex anteriorly and is involved in refracting light rays to focus on
the retina.

Choroid, ciliary body and iris
•	Choroid is located just beneath the sclera. It is a thin pigmented layer and rich with blood
vessels.
•	Ciliary body is the anterior continuation of the choroid layer consisting of smooth muscle
fibers (ciliary muscle) and sensory epithelial cells. Most of these smooth muscle fibers
are circular. Therefore, ciliary muscles act as a sphincter. The ciliary body holds the lens
in place by suspensory ligaments. The size and thickness of the lens can be controlled
by contraction and relaxation of the ciliary muscle fibers attached to these suspensory
ligaments. Epithelial cells secrete aqueous humor.
•	Iris is a circular colored body composed of pigment cells. It is located at the front of the
eye. It extends anteriorly from the ciliary body and is present behind the cornea and in front
of the lens. It contains two layers of smooth muscle fibers which are arranged as circular
and radial bundles. In the center of the iris is a hole called pupil. The Iris controls the amount of light
entering the pupil by changing size which is mediated by the autonomic nervous system.
Pigments prevent penetration of excessive light.

Lens

The lens is lying immediately behind the pupil. It is an elastic, biconvex transparent disc made up
of protein enclosed within a transparent capsule. It refracts light rays reflected by objects in front
of the eye and focuses them on the retina to form the image. By changing the thickness, the lens
can vary its refractive power in order to focus rays on the retina.
Aqueous fluid (aqueous humor) and vitreous body (vitreous humor)
In front of the lens, a clear watery substance is present which is called aqueous fluid (Blockage
of ducts that drain this fluid can produce glaucoma causing vision loss). Aqueous fluid supplies
nutrients and removes waste from the cornea, lens and lens capsule which have no blood supply.
Behind the lens a colorless and transparent jelly like vitreous humor is present. It maintains
enough intra ocular pressure to support the retina against choroid and prevents the eyeball from
collapsing. 

Retina
•	Retina is the innermost lining of the eye. It consists of three layers: Outer pigmented
epithelium, middle photoreceptive layer and inner layer with neurons. A photoreceptor layer
consists of sensory cells (rods and cones) which contain photosensory pigments that can
convert light rays into membrane potential change. Retina is thickest at the back. At the
center of the posterior part of the retina, macula lutea (yellow spot) is present. In the center
of the yellow spot there is a little depression called the fovea centralis which contains only
cones. Towards the anterior part of the retina there are fewer cones than rods. About 0.5
cm to the nasal side of the macula lutea all the nerve fibers of the retina converge to form
the optic nerve. The small area of retina where the optic nerve leaves eye is the blind spot
(optic disk). It lacks photoreceptors.
•	Photoreceptor cells: There are two types: rods and cones. Within the outer segment of
these cells is a stack of membranous disks in which visual pigments are embedded. In the
retina, more rods are present than cones. In the rods visual pigment is rhodopsin. They are
sensitive to light but do not distinguish colours. They enable us to see at night but only in
black and white. In the cones, visual pigment is photopsin. They provide color vision.
They contribute very little to night vision as they are less sensitive. There are three types
of cones, each of which has a different sensitivity across the visible spectrum providing an
optimal response to red, green or blue light.
•	Neurons in the retina: several types of neurons are present including bipolar cells and
ganglion cells 

Functioning of the human eyes

Light is reflected into the eye by the objects in the field of vision. In order to achieve clear vision,
light reflected from the object within the visual field should be refracted mainly by the lens and
focused on the retina of each eye. The processes which are involved in producing a clear image
on the retina are refraction of light rays, changing the size of the pupil and accommodation.
Then photoreceptor cells in the retina convert light energy to voltage changes leading to action
potentials which are sent through the optic nerve to the brain for perception of visual objects. In
the retina, stimulation of rods leads to black and white vision. Cones are sensitive to light and
color therefore bright light is needed to activate them and give sharp clear color, vision. The
different wavelengths of visible light activate light sensitive pigments in the cones which result in
perception of different colours.

•	Refraction of light rays
Light rays coming from the visual field pass through the conjunctiva first, then successively
through cornea, aqueous fluid, lens and vitreous body before reaching the retina. During this
process light rays are refracted (bent) to focus them on the retina as they all are denser than the 
air. Lens has changing refractory power while all the other parts (conjunctiva, cornea, aqueous
fluid and vitreous body) have constant refractory powers. Light rays are mostly refracted by
the biconvex lens.
•	Changing the size of the pupil, convergence and accommodation
For clear vision, the amount of light entering the eye is controlled by changing the size of the
pupil which is mediated by the autonomic nervous system.
•	Constriction of the pupil: In bright light, pupils are constricted to avoid entering too much
light into the eye and damaging the sensitive retina. In dim light, the pupils are dilated to
allow entering sufficient light to activate photoreceptors which would eventually enable the
vision. Light rays coming from distant objects need least refraction but as the object
comes closer, the amount of refraction needs to be increased to focus light rays on the
retina. Hence for near vision the eye must make some adjustments.
•	Movement of the eyeball (convergence): As light rays from near objects enter the two eyes
at different angles, for clear vision they must stimulate corresponding areas of two retina.
Muscles attached to the eyeball rotate the eyes to achieve convergence. This is under
autonomic control.
•	Changing the refractory power of the lens: Parasympathetic nervous supply to the ciliary
body controls the contraction of ciliary muscles and accommodation of eye. Accommodation
is important in near vision for focusing on near objects. In near vision the ciliary muscles
contract thereby moving the ciliary body inwards towards lens. As a result, convexity of the
lens is increased due to the reduction of the pull of the suspensory ligaments on the lens.
Thus light waves from the near objects are focused on the retina. When seeing a distant
object, ciliary muscles relax, then ciliary body moves away from the lens that increases the
pull of the suspensory ligaments on the lens, so convexity of the lens is reduced. Thus, light
rays from distant objects are focused on the retina.

Focusing the image on the retina and converting the light energy to action potential to be
transmitted to the brain

•	The light waves coming from the object are bent (refracted) and focused on the retina. This
process produces an image on the retina which is upside down. Once light rays reach the
retina, chemical changes happen in the photoreceptive cells (rods and cones).
•	Bipolar cells receive information from photoreceptor cells and each ganglion cell gathers
inputs from several bipolar cells. In addition, specific neurons in the retina can integrate
information across the retina. Ganglion cells form the optic nerve fibers that transmit
sensation from the eyes as action potential to the brain. This change will generate a nerve
impulse.
•	The optic nerve transmits this nerve impulse into occipital lobes (visual area) of the
cerebrum. There the visual objects are perceived in the correct way (the right way up) by
the brain.
•	Choroid functions in absorption of light after the entered light stimulate sensory receptors
in the retina.","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
76,Animal Form and Function - II,Monocular vision and binocular vision inhuman,"In humans, both eyes are located in front of the face which facilitates coordinate division from the
two eyes. However, it is possible to see visual fields with one eye. Seeing the visual field using
only one eye is called monocular vision. However, when one eye is issued, three-dimensional vision
is impaired especially in relation to the judgment of speed and distance.
Seeing the visual field using two eyes with greater overlapping fields of view is called binocular
vision. The left eye views more on the left of the visual fields. The right eye views more on the
right of the visual fields. Even though each eye views a scene from a slightly different angle, in
the middle the visual fields are overlapped. However, only one image is perceived due to the
fusion of left, middle and right of the visual field images from the two eyes in the occipital lobe
of the cerebrum.
Unlike monocular vision, binocular vision enables three dimensional views. So binocular vision
is very important in judging the speed and distance of an approaching object such as a vehicle.
It gives a more accurate assessment of one object relative to another in relation to distance, depth,
height and width. In some individuals, binocular vision may be impaired. Such individuals face
difficulties judging the speed and distance of an approaching object.

77,Animal Form and Function - II,Structure of the human ear,"Human ear is divided into three parts; the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear.
Outer wear consists of the piano and auditory canal. Auditory canal is a slightly “S” shaped tube and
lined by hairy skin with numerous modified sweat glands which secrete ear wax. The auditory canal
extends to the tympanic membrane which is located in between the middle and the outer wear.
Middle ear (tympanic cavity) is an air-filled cavity within the temporal bone. It is lined with simple
epithelium. In the medial wall of the middle ear, there are two openings called oval window and
round window. Oval window is covered by a small bone called stapes. The round window is covered
by a fine fibrous tissue. Three very small bones (ear ossicles) called malleus, incus and stapes
extend across the middle ear from tympanic membrane to the oval window. They form movable
joints with each other and the medial wall of the cavity at the oval window. Malleus 1s in contact
with the tympanic membrane and form a movable joint with the incus. Incus articulates with the
stapes which fit with the oval window. A long tube called Eustachian tube connects the middle
ear to the pharynx. 
Inner ear is formed from a network of channels and cavities in temporal bone which are called
bony labyrinth. Within the bony labyrinth, a network of fluid filled membranes called membranous
labyrinth is present which lines and fills the bony labyrinth. The inner ear is composed of three main
regions: vestibule, three semicircular canals and cochlea. Vestibule is the expanded part near
the middle ear. Oval and round windows are present in its lateral walls. The vestibular contains two
membranous sacs called utricle and saccule. Semicircular canals are three tubes arranged at
right angles to one another so that one is situated in each of the three planes of space. They are
continuous with the vestibule. Cochlea is a coiled structure with a broad base which is continuous
with the vestibule. Cochlea has three compartments: an upper vestibular canal, a lower tympanic
canal and middle cochlear duct which is a small canal that separates the upper and lower canals.
Vestibular canal originates at the oval window and the tympanic canal ends at the round window. The
two canals are continuous with each other and filled with perilymph. The cochlear duct is a part
of the membranous labyrinth and filled with endolymph. The floor of the cochlear duct is called
the basilar membrane which bears the organ of Corti (spiral organ). It contains supporting cells
and specialized cochlear hair cells containing mechanoreceptors (auditory receptors) of the ear.
Hairs of the cochlear hair cells project into the cochlear duct. Many hairs are in contact with the
tectorial membrane that hangs over the organ of Corti. Hair cells synapse with the dendrites of
sensory neurons that combine to form the auditory nerve which transmits auditory information
to the brain. 

Functions of the human ear

Hearing

Vibrating objects produce pressure waves in the surrounding air. In hearing, the ear transduces
these pressure waves (mechanical stimulus) to changing membrane potential leading to generation
of nerve impulses that are transmitted to the brain which perceives as sound.
The outer wear collects and concentrates the sound waves and directs them along the auditory
canal towards the tympanic membrane. This causes the tympanic membrane to vibrate. Tympanic
membrane vibrations are transmitted and amplified through the middle ear by the movement of
three jointed ear ossicles.
The ear ossicles transmit the vibrations to the oval window which is located on the membrane
of the cochlear surface. When the stapes vibrates against the oval window, pressure waves are
created in the perilymph inside the cochlea. Most fluid pressure waves in the vestibular canal
are transmitted to the endolymph of cochlea duct which push down the basilar membrane. As a
result, the basilar membrane and attached hair cells vibrate up and down. This causes bending of
hair projecting from the hair cell against the fixed tectorial membrane which lies above the hair
cells. This results in the stimulation of auditory receptors in the auditory hair cells which lead to
generation of nerve impulses. These nerve impulses are passed through the auditory nerve to the
auditory area of the brain (temporal lobe of the cerebrum) for sound perception.
After the sound perception, the fluid wave is finally dissipated into the middle ear by vibration of
the membrane of the round window. The Eustachian tube maintains the air pressure on both sides of
tympanic membrane at the atmospheric pressure level.
Equilibrium
Semicircular canals and vestibule located in the inner ear provide information about the position
of the head in space and contribute to maintain the posture and balance.
Utricle and saccule of the vestibule perceive position with respect to gravity or linear movements.
Each of these endolymph filled chambers contain hair cells that project into a gelatinous material

in which small calcium carbonate particles (otolith) are embedded. When the head is tilted
otoliths press on the hairs projecting into the gels bending the hair bundle. These deflections in
the hair cells cause membrane potential changes which are transmitted as nerve impulses into the
cerebellum.
The semicircular canals, arranged in three spatial planes detect angular movements of the head.
Within each canal, hair cells form a cluster with the hairs projecting into a gelatinous cap. Changes
in the position of the head causes movements in the perilymph and endolymph. As a result, hair
cells are stimulated and resulting nerve impulses are transmitted to the brain. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
78,Animal Form and Function - II,Basic structures and functions of the human skin,"In the human body skin is the largest organ. It consists of two main layers which are the epidermis
and the dermis. The layer underneath the skin is called subcutaneous layer which is composed of
adipose tissue and areolar tissue.

Epidermis

Epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin which consists of stratified keratinized squamous
epithelium. Epidermis is not supplied with blood vessels. But its deeper layers are provided with
nutrients and oxygen by the interstitial fluid of the dermis finally drained away as lymph. There
are several layers of cells in the epidermis. The deepest layer is the germinative layer from which
epidermal cells are originated constantly. These cells undergo gradual changes as they progress
towards the surface of the skin. The cells on the surface are flat, thin, non-nucleated and dead, in
which the cytoplasm has been replaced by keratin which is a fibrous protein. The surface cells are
constantly rubbed off and replaced by the cells underneath. In areas where the skin is subjected to
wear and tear, the epidermis is thicker (e.g. palms and fingers of the hand, sole of the foot)
Melanocytes in the deep germinative layer secrete a dark pigment called melanin contribute to
the skin color. In addition, the extent of oxygen saturation in the circulating blood in the dermis,
excessive levels of bile pigments and carotenes in the fat layer can affect the skin color.

Dermis

Dermis is composed of areolar connective tissue. The matrix contains collagen fibers interlaced
with elastic fibers. Collagen fibers bind water and give the skin its tensile strength. Fibroblasts,
macrophages and mast cells are the main cells found in the dermis.
The structures present in dermis are
- blood and lymph vessels
- sensory nerve endings
- sweat glands
- sebaceous glands
- hair, arrector pili muscles
- sensory receptors (Meissner’s corpuscle, Pacinian corpuscle, free nerve endings, bulb of
Krause, organ of Ruffini, Merkle discs)



Functions of the human skin
•	Protection: skin acts as a defensive barrier against invasion by microorganisms, entrance of
chemicals and physical agents and dehydration. The skin contains keratinized epithelium
which is relatively waterproof. This layer can protect deeper and more delicate structures.
The skin contains specialized immune cells which can phagocytose foreign invasions. The
melanin pigments protect against the harmful effects of UV radiation. 
•	Regulation of the body temperature: The skin contributes to regulation body temperature
as it provides passage through which heat can be lost or gained depending on the body
requirements. When body temperature is increased above the normal range, sweat glands
secrete sweat onto the skin surface. Evaporation of sweat cools the body surface. When
heat stressed, heat loss can be promoted by increasing the blood flow through the skin
capillaries by dilating arterioles. When the body temperature falls beyond the normal range
heat loss through the skin capillaries can be minimized by constricting arterioles in the
dermis. When cold stressed, contraction of erector pili muscles attached to the hair can
generate body heat and contribute to the heat production.
•	Cutaneous sensation: Skin contains sensory receptors which are sensitive to touch,
pressure, temperature and pain. Upon stimulation, nerve impulses are generated which are
transmitted to the brain for sensory perception.
•	Synthesis of vitamin D: Exposure to sunlight can convert lipid-based substances in
the skin to vitamin D.
•	Excretion: Skin serves as a minor excretory organ. Sodium chloride, urea, and aromatic
substances such as garlic can be excreted in sweat.","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
79,Animal Form and Function - II,The role of human endocrine system,"Endocrine system is one of the two basic systems for coordination and regulation of activities in
the human body. Compared to the nervous system, endocrine control is mainly involved in slower
but more precise adjustments in maintaining homeostasis in the body. The endocrine system
functions through “chemical signaling” by hormones which are secreted by specific endocrine
glands or endocrine cells.
Endocrine glands are ductless glands consisting of groups of specialized cells which secrete
hormones (chemical messengers) that diffuse directly into the bloodstream and reach the specific
target organs/tissues that may be located quite distantly. Diffusion of hormones from these
endocrine glands to the bloodstream is facilitated by the extensive capillary networks surrounding
the glands.
Hormone is a specific type of signaling molecule secreted by an endocrine gland/endocrine
cells which travels in the blood and acts on specific target cells elsewhere in the body, changing
the target cell functioning. Although a specific hormone can reach all body cells, only the cells
(target cells) which have matching receptors for that hormone are responsive to the chemical
signal. When the hormone binds to the specific receptor of the target cell, it acts as a switch
influencing chemical/metabolic reactions within the cell. Through chemical signals, hormones
can communicate regulatory messages throughout the body.
Human endocrine system mainly consists of specific endocrine glands that are widely separated
from each other. Endocrine glands of the human endocrine system include hypothalamus,
pituitary gland, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands, islets of Langerhans (in the
pancreas), gonads, thymus gland and pineal gland. In addition to these endocrine glands, isolated
endocrine cells are found in some organs and tissues (e.g. stomach, small intestine, kidneys etc.)

which secrete specific hormones (e.g. isolated endocrine cells in the stomach secrete the hormone,
gastrin). 

Hypothalamus
Hypothalamus is located at the base of the fore brain just below the thalamus and connected to

the pituitary gland. Seven hormones that are produced and released by the hypothalamus (five
releasing hormones and two releasing inhibiting hormones), act on the anterior pituitary (target
site). These hypothalamic hormones regulate the secretion of anterior pituitary hormones (Table
5.3). Two other hormones produced by the hypothalamus (oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone) are
stored in the posterior pituitary until they are released into the bloodstream and act on specific
target sites. 

The hypothalamus regulates the anterior pituitary gland by releasing specific hormones that control various physiological functions. These hypothalamic hormones include:
•	Growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH): Stimulates the secretion of growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary, promoting growth and metabolism.
•	Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH): Triggers the anterior pituitary to release thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which influences thyroid function.
•	Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH): Stimulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), regulating the adrenal glands.
•	Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH): Promotes the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), important for reproductive functions.
•	Prolactin releasing hormone (PRH): Encourages the anterior pituitary to secrete prolactin, which affects lactation and reproductive functions.
•	Prolactin inhibiting hormone (PIH): Inhibits the secretion of prolactin to regulate its levels in the body.
•	Growth hormone release inhibiting hormone (GHRIH): Suppresses the secretion of both growth hormone (GH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).
•	 Growth hormone (GH) has both tropic and non-tropic effects, targeting both endocrine and non-endocrine cells. It is the most abundant hormone produced by the anterior pituitary","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
80,Animal Form and Function - II,Glands,"Pituitary gland
Pituitary gland is situated in the fore brain just below the hypothalamus to which it is attached by
a stalk. The pituitary gland consists of two main parts (anterior pituitary and posterior pituitary) which
are actually two fused glands that perform different functions.
The anterior pituitary synthesizes specific hormones (Table 5.4). The anterior pituitary connects
with the hypothalamus through portal blood vessels. In response to the specific releasing hormones
secreted from the hypothalamus (Table: 5.3), anterior pituitary secretes its specific hormones to
the blood stream. Some hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary redirect the chemical signals
from hypothalamus to other endocrine glands. These anterior pituitary hormones are called tropic
hormones (TSH, ACTH, FSH and LH) as their specific target site is another endocrine gland or

endocrine cell. The hormone prolactin which is secreted by the anterior pituitary is not a tropic
hormone as its target sites are non-endocrine tissues. Prolactin promotes only non-tropic effects.
Growth hormone (GH) secreted by the anterior pituitary has a “tropic as well as non-tropic effects”
as its target sites can be endocrine cells as well as non-endocrine cells. GH is the most abundant
hormone synthesized by the anterior pituitary. 

Hormones play critical roles in regulating various physiological processes by targeting specific organs or tissues. The following are key hormones, their target sites, and their functions:
•	Growth hormone (GH): Targets all body cells, particularly bones and muscles. It promotes tissue growth by stimulating protein synthesis and regulates metabolism.
•	Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH): Targets the thyroid gland. It stimulates the secretion of thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxin) and supports the growth of the thyroid gland.
•	Prolactin: Targets the mammary glands. It stimulates milk production and, in conjunction with other hormones, promotes milk secretion by the mammary glands.
•	Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH): Targets the adrenal cortex. It stimulates the secretion of glucocorticoid hormones from the adrenal cortex, which are involved in stress responses and metabolic processes.
•	Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH): In females, it targets the ovaries, promoting the growth and development of ovarian follicles. In males, it targets the testes to stimulate spermatogenesis.
•	Luteinizing hormone (LH): In females, it targets the ovaries, triggering ovulation and promoting the formation of the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone. In males, LH targets the testes, stimulating the secretion of testosterone.
The posterior pituitary, which is an extension of the hypothalamus connecting via axons, does not
synthesize hormones but secretes two hypothalamic hormones (oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone)
to the bloodstream. Oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) synthesized in the hypothalamic
neurons travel through the long hypothalamic axons that reach into the posterior pituitary. These
hormones are stored in the axon ends located in the posterior pituitary until they are released into
the blood stream in response to nerve impulses transmitted from the hypothalamus. 

The hormones antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin play important roles in regulating bodily functions:
•	Antidiuretic hormone (ADH): Targets the distal convoluted tubules of the nephrons and collecting ducts in the kidneys. It stimulates the reabsorption of water by increasing the permeability of these tubules and ducts to water, which helps maintain water balance in the body.
•	Oxytocin: Targets the mammary glands and uterine muscles. In the mammary glands, it stimulates milk ejection by causing the contraction of smooth muscles. In the uterus, oxytocin promotes parturition (childbirth) by triggering the contraction of uterine smooth muscles.

temperature.
- constriction of blood vessels in the skin which divert the blood from the skin to deeper
tissues thereby reducing heat loss through the skin surface
- shivering: rapid repetitive contractions of skeletal muscles to generate heat
- contracting hair erector muscles to generate heat to some extent
- stimulating secretions of more thyroid hormones (e.g. thyroxin) and adrenalin into the
blood which increase the metabolic rate and cellular metabolism (especially oxidation of
fat in the liver) to produce more heat 
When body temperature returns to the normal range, the cold temperature sensitive receptors
are no longer stimulated and their signals to the hypothalamic thermostat stop due to negative
feedback mechanism. Then, additional heat generating mechanisms in the body stop and blood
flow to the peripheries returns normal.

Homeostatic regulation of blood glucose level in human

In humans, normal blood glucose level is 70 — 110 mg/100 mL (while fasting) which is sufficient
for immediate needs of the body cells. The blood glucose levels can fluctuate throughout the day
within physiological limits in non-diabetic persons. In the human body, blood sugar levels are
homeostatic ally controlled by opposing actions of two hormones secreted by the pancreas: insulin
and glucagon.
High blood glucose levels exceeding the normal limits, stimulate the secretion of insulin hormone
from beta cells of the islets of Langerhans into the circulating blood. Insulin acts on specific target
tissues to promote lowering of the blood glucose level. Insulin in the circulating blood stimulates
transport of glucose into the body cells and use of glucose by body cells for ATP production
(glucose may be broken down into carbon dioxide and water), conversion of glucose to glycogen
in liver and skeletal muscle cells for storage, and conversion of glucose to fatty acids and storage
of fat in adipose tissues. When glucose level in the blood reaches normal range, blood glucose
level can in turn directly control the secretion of insulin levels from the pancreas through negative
feedback. This mechanism prevents further lowering of the glucose level in the blood beyond the
normal limits.
Low blood glucose levels below the normal limit, stimulate the secretion of glucagon from alpha
cells of the islets of Langerhans into the circulating blood. Glucagon acts on specific target tissues
to promote increase of the blood glucose level. Glucagon promotes the breakdown of glycogen
in the liver and skeletal muscles and release of glucose into blood. When glucose level in the
blood reaches normal range, blood glucose level can in turn directly control the secretion of

glucagon levels from the pancreas through negative feedback which prevents further increasing
of the glucose level in the blood beyond the normal limits.

Osmoregulation

When there is osmotic balance, amount of water and concentration of solutes is same inside and
outside the cells. Osmoregulation is important for organisms to keep a constant, optimal osmotic
pressure within the body. In the humans, osmoregulation ensures that the total blood volume and
the concentration of dissolved substances in the plasma and tissue fluids remain constant within
a favorable range. 
In the human body, osmotic balance is achieved by two ways: controlling the amount of water
and controlling the amount of solutes gained and lost by the body. Blood water homeostasis is
controlled by the hypothalamus (Refer 5.41 Grade 12 Resource book). Hypothalamus contains
osmoreceptors which can detect the osmolarity of the blood passing through the brain. In response
to the osmolarity (or osmotic pressure) of the blood, the hypothalamus controls the sensation of
thirst, and secretion of the hormone ADH from the posterior pituitary.
When blood osmolarity is increased beyond the physiological limits, it is sensed by the
osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus which stimulates the posterior pituitary to release ADH to
the blood circulation. ADH acts on the kidney tubules and stimulates the reabsorption of water
through distal convoluted tubules of the nephrons and collecting ducts producing concentrated
urine. When blood osmolarity is decreased, ADH is not secreted, so water reabsorption through
distal convoluted tubules of the nephrons and collecting ducts stop thereby producing diluted
urine. In addition, low blood volume and low blood sodium ions stimulate the kidneys to produce
Angiotensin II which stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone hormone (Refer 5.42
Grade 12 Resource book). Aldosterone stimulates the reabsorption of sodium ions by the kidney
tubules which is accompanied by the water retention, thereby increasing blood volume and blood
pressure. Hence, kidneys play a major role in osmoregulation in the human body.

Role of the liver in homeostasis.
Liver is an active organ and plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis of the human
body. The functions of the liver include the following.
•	Carbohydrate metabolism: The liver plays an important role in maintaining blood glucose
levels within normal ranges. When blood glucose is increased (e.g. after a meal), glucose
is stored as glycogen under the stimulation of insulin. If blood glucose level is reduced
(e.g. starvation), glycogen is converted back to glucose under the influence of glucagon
hormone.
•	Fat metabolism: When the body needs excess energy, fats that are stored in the liver cells
are metabolized to produce ATP
•	Protein metabolism: In the liver cells, nitrogen part of some amino acids that are not
needed for new protein synthesis are removed (deamination) and excreted in urine or
transferred to carbohydrates to synthesize new nonessential amino acids (transamination).
Liver also synthesizes plasma proteins (e.g. albumin, globulins) from amino acids.
•	Breakdown of erythrocytes and defense against microbial infections: In humans, liver
is a site for red blood cell breakdown. Macrophages located in the liver are involved in
microbial defense.
•	Detoxification of drugs and toxicants: The liver plays an important role in detoxification.
•	Production of heat: Liver is the major heat producing organ of the body as it has a high
metabolic rate. 
•	Storage of nutrients: Glycogen, fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), some water soluble
vitamins- B12 and essential minerals such as iron, copper are stored in liver.
•	Inactivation of hormones: Some hormones are inactivated by the liver after their biological
action.
•	Secretion of bile: Liver cells synthesize the components present in the bile which is
important in fat digestion and excretion of bilirubin (a breakdown product of red blood
cells).","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
81,Animal Form and Function - II,Reproduction,"Modes of reproduction seen among animals

Reproduction is a biological process through which a new generation of individuals is produced
form the existing organisms. Two modes of reproduction are found among the animals: Asexual
reproduction and Sexual reproduction. For most animals, reproduction is mainly or entirely
sexual. Several forms of asexual reproduction are also seen especially among invertebrates.

Asexual reproduction

Asexual reproduction is a mechanism through which new individuals are generated from a single
parent without the fusion of egg and sperm. Asexual reproduction relies entirely on mitotic cell
division. Asexual reproduction allows the rapid multiplication of individuals from single parents.
Hence no time or energy is spent in searching the mates for reproduction. The produced
offspring are genetically identical to each other and to the single parent. Several methods of
asexual reproduction are found among invertebrates. They include budding, fragmentation and
regeneration, and parthenogenesis.

•	Budding: Budding is a form of asexual reproduction in which new individuals arise form
outgrowths of the animal. e.g. /vdra — A localized mass of mitotically dividing cells,
develops into a small Hydra, which can eventually detach from the parent.
•	Fragmentation and regeneration: This is a form of asexual reproduction which involves
breaking of the body or part of the body into several pieces, followed by the growth of a
separate individual from each piece. Each fragment develops into a complete animal by
regrowth of lost body parts (regeneration). e.g. Certain annelid worms, numerous sponges,
cnidarians.
•	Parthenogenesis: This is an unusual form of asexual reproduction in which an egg develops
into a complete individual without being fertilized. Among invertebrates, parthenogenesis
occurs in some animals such as bees, ants, aphids and wasps. The progeny can be haploid
or diploid. In honeybees — males (drones) are fertile haploid adults that develop through
parthenogenesis, whereas females including both sterile workers and the fertile queen, are
diploid adults that developed from fertilized eggs. Parthenogenesis has also been observed
very rarely among vertebrates (e.g. some lizards and fish).

Sexual reproduction

Sexual reproduction isa mechanism through which a new individual is developed from a diploid
zygoteasa result of the fusion of two haploid gametes (the sperm and the egg)whichareproduced
by two individuals (the male and the female parents respectively). The female gamete, the egg,
is large and non-motile, while the male gamete, the sperm, is generally much smaller and motile.
The fusion of the female and male gametes forms a diploid cell called the zygote. The animal
that develops mitotically from a zygote can in turn give rise to gametes by meiosis. For the most
animals, reproduction is mainly or entirely sexual.
•	 Gamete formation: In animals, reproductive cells called gametes (sperms and eggs) are
the vehicles that transmit genes from one generation to the next. Each gamete is a haploid,
unicellular reproductive cell. Gametes in animals are formed by meiosis in special organs
called gonads.
•	Bisexual organism and Unisexual organism: Ina bisexual organism (Hermaphrodite),
one individual has both female and male reproductive structures and therefore is able
to produce both male and female gametes by the same individual. e.g. Earthworms. In
unisexual organisms (dioecious), one individual bear either male or female reproductive
structures. Therefore, production of male or female gametes occurs in separate organisms.
e.g. Humans
•	Fertilization: Union of egg and sperm (gametes) for fusion of their nuclei to produce a
zygote is called fertilization. Fertilization can be either external or internal.
Externalfertilizationoccursinaquaticenvironments.Inspecieswithexternalfertilization,
the female releases eggs while the male releases sperm into the external environment and
fertilization occurs in the water. A moist habitat is almost always required for external
fertilization both to prevent the gametes from drying out and to allow the sperm to swim
toward the egg. e.g. Many invertebrates, amphibians, most bony fish.

In internal fertilization, sperms are deposited in or near the female reproductive
tract and fertilization occurs within the female reproductive tract. e.g. insects, reptiles,
mammals. Internal fertilization is an adaptation that enables sperm to reach an egg even
when the environment is dry. The male copulatory organ delivers sperm and the female
reproductive tract often has receptacles for storage and delivery of sperm to mature eggs.
Internal fertilization is typically associated with the production of fewer gametes than
external fertilization but results in the survival of a higher fraction of zygotes. Internal
fertilization often provides greater protection to the embryos. Many animals show
parental care. Internally fertilized eggs of birds and other reptiles possess shells and
internal membranes that protect against water loss and physical damage. Some retain the
embryo for a portion of any development within the female reproductive tract.

Significance of asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction

Asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction are important biological processes to ensure
existence of a species.
Asexual reproduction allows rapid multiplication of individuals from single parents. Hence no time
or energy is needed to be spent in searching mates for reproduction. In asexual reproduction,
there is no or very little genetic variation within a population as the produced offspring are
genetically identical to each other and to the single parent. Therefore, asexual reproduction would
be more advantageous in stable, favorable environments as it can propagate successful genotypes
specifically. However, any mutation in the parent cell can cause harmful effects on the survival
ability of the offspring in changing environments. If there is a harmful mutation in the organisms,
environment changes could be deadly to all the individuals in the population.

Unlike asexual reproduction, sexual reproduction results in the production of a unique offspring by
combining genetic materials from two parents. Meiotic recombination during sexual reproduction
helps produce varied genotypes. Unique gene combinations formed during sexual reproduction
would be advantageous as this can enhance reproductive success and survival of a species in
changing environments. Beneficial gene combination arising through recombination may speed
up adaptation. During sexual reproduction, shuffling of genes might allow a population to clear
sets of harmful genes more readily which would enhance the survival of the species. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
82,Animal Form and Function - II,Structure and function of the human male reproductive system,"Main internal reproductive structures of a male consist of gonads (testes) which produce sperm
and reproductive hormones, epididymis which store mature sperms, accessory glands that secrete
products required for sperm movement and ducts that transport the mature sperm and glandular
secretions. The external reproductive organs of a male are the scrotum and penis. 
•	Scrotum: Scrotum is a pouch formed by a fold of the body wall. Scrotum is divided
into two compartments. Each compartment contains one testis, one epididymis and part
of the spermatic cords which suspend the testis in the scrotum.
•	
•	Tests: The tests are found within the scrotum which allows the maintenance of the testis
temperature 2°C below the core body temperature. Sperms are produced properly only when
the testes are cooler than the rest of the body. The testes develop in the abdominal cavity and
descend into the scrotum just before birth. The testes are cooled by their position outside the
abdominal cavity and the thin covering of the scrotum. Each testis contains many lobules.
Within each lobule there are highly coiled (convoluted) loops called seminiferous tubules.
Sperms are produced within these tubules. Different cells that undergo spermatogenesis
are surrounded and connected to special types of supporting cells (Sertoli cells) located in
the seminiferous tubule. Sertoli cells extend from the wall of the seminiferous tubules to
the lumen. These cells secrete the hormone inhibin and nourish and provide attachment
for cells that are in different stages of spermatogenesis. Groups of cells called Leydig cells
(or interstitial cells) are present in the connective tissue between the seminiferous tubules.
Leydig cells secrete the hormone testosterone and other androgens after puberty which
promote spermatogenesis in the tubules. The seminiferous tubules combine to form a single
tubule (duct) at the upper part of the testes.
•	Epididymis: Epididymis is the tightly packed mass that is formed by the repeatedly
folded long duct originating from combined seminiferous tubules in the testis. From the
seminiferous tubules, the sperm passes into the epididymis. Since it is very long (about 6 m 
in length), it takes about 3 weeks for sperm to travel the length of this duct. During this time
the sperms become matured and motile. Matured sperms are stored within the epididymis
until ejaculation.
• Vas deference, ejaculatory duct, urethra and penis: During ejaculation, sperm are
propelled form each epididymis through a muscular duct, the vas deferens. Each vas
deferens (one from each epididymis) extends round and behind the urinary bladder, where
it joins a duct from a seminal vesicle, forming a short ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory
duets open into the urethra which is the passageway for both urinary excretion and delivery
of sperms in semen into the female reproductive tract. The urethra runs through the penis
and opens Toth outside at the tip of the Peni which contains erectile tissues derived from
modified veins and capillaries.

Spermatogenesis

Spermatogenesisistheprocessofmalegameteformationwhichincludesformationofspermatocytes
from spermatogonium, meiotic division of the spermatocytes, and transformation of the four
resulting spermatids (from each sperm a to cite) into sperm at zoa (sperm). Spermatogenesis occurs
within the seminiferous tubules of the testes. The time taken to produce mature sperm cells from a
specific spermatogonia in a seminiferous tubule is about seven weeks from start to finish.
The formation and development of sperms is continuous and inexhaustible in adult human
males. Cell division and maturation during spermatogenesis occur throughout the seminiferous
tubules. Hundreds of millions of sperm are produced each day by spermatogenesis. In contrast
to oogenesis (discussed later), in spermatogenesis all four cells produced during meiosis of each
primary spermatocyte develop into mature sperms. Spermatogenesis starts a puberty and occurs
throughout life. Spermatogenesis produces mature sperms from precursor cells in a continuous
sequence.

Main steps in Spermatogenesis

• The stem cells (2n) that give rise to sperms (Spermatogonia stem cells) arise from mitotic
division and differentiation of primordial germ cells in the embryonic testes. These stem
cells are situated near the edge of these viniferous tubules. In mature testis, their progeny
moves in ward as they pass through the different stages of maturation.
• In mature testes, the stem cells divide mitotically to form Spermatogonia (2n), which in
turn generate primary spermatocytes (2n) by mitosis.
• Each primary sperm atocytegivesriseto four spermatids(n)through meiosis (Two secondary
spermatocytes- meiosis1 and two spermatids from each secondary sperm a located in
meiosis -II), reducing the chromosome number from diploid(2nN6inhumans)to haploid
(n=23).
• These spermatids differentiate into sperms with its characteristic head, midpiece and tail.
• The sperms are released into the fluid-filled lumen of the tubule, and they travel along the
tubule into the epididymis, where they become mature and motile.

After puberty, Leydig cells are present between the seminiferous tubules to secrete the hormone
testosterone which promotes spermatogenesis. Different cells that undergo spermatogenesis are
surrounded and connected to special types of supporting cells called Sertoli cells. These cells
extend from the wall of the seminiferous tubules to the lumen. These cells secrete inhibin hormone
and nourish and provide attachment for cells that are in different stages of spermatogenesis. 

Each sperm is made up of three main parts, the head, midpiece (body) and tail.
Head of the sperm contains the haploid nucleus carrying the paternal genetic material. A special
vesicle called the acrosome is present at the anterior end of the head. It contains hydrolytic
enzymes such as trypsin and hyaluronidase that help the sperm to penetrate the outer layers of the
ovum. Midpiece of the sperm contains many mitochondria that provides ATP necessary for the
movement of the tail.

The tail of the sperm contains a long flagellum with a typical 9+2 arrangement of microtubules. It is
produced by the centriole found near the base of the nucleus. The tail enables the sperm to swim
along the female reproductive tract towards an ovum.

Semen

The semen is the fluid that contains a mixture of sperms and the secretions of three sets of accessory
glands. The semen is discharged from the urethra during ejaculation. Usually, a normal ejaculate
contains about 2-5 mL of semen and the sperm count in the semen may be in the range of 40-100
million/ml. Normally, the sperms comprise less than 10% of the final ejaculate. Main fraction of
the semen is made up of secretions from seminal vesicles and the prostate gland.
The semen contains several components such as mucus, enzymes, prostaglandins, ascorbic acid,
citrate and fructose which promote the survival of sperm. The semen provides a liquid medium
for the sperm movement and also helps to neutralize the acidity in the female reproductive tract.
The life expectancy of a sperm is about 48-72 hours after ejaculation.

Accessory glands associated with the male reproductive system

There are three sets of accessory glands that produce secretions necessary for sperm survival and
movement. They are seminal vesicles, prostate gland and bulbourethral glands.
•	Seminal vesicles: They are a pair of two small pouches that produce a thick, yellowish
fluid that is expelled during ejaculation. Seminal fluid is alkaline to protect the sperm in
the acidic environment of the vagina. It contains mucus, fructose (that provides most of the
sperm’s energy), a coagulating enzyme (helps semen coagulates after ejaculation), ascorbic
acid and local regulators called prostaglandins. This fluid contributes to about 60% of the
volume of semen. Each seminal vesicle opens into a short duct that joins the corresponding
vas deference to form an ejaculatory duct. 
•	Prostate gland: This gland is found below the urinary bladder. It secretes a thin, milky fluid
directly into the urethra through small ducts. This milky secretion contains anticoagulant
enzymes and citrate which is a sperm nutrient. This fluid contributes to about 30% of the
volume of semen.
•	Bulbourethral glands: They are a pair of small glands found along the urethra below the
prostate. These glands secrete a clear alkaline mucus that is able to neutralize any acidic
urine remaining in the urethra and lubricates the lining of the urethra. 

Hormonal control of the male reproductive system 

 in males, in response to the release of GnRH from the hypothalamus (just before puberty),
results in the release of FSH and LH by the anterior pituitary. Rising levels of the FSH and
LH hormones at puberty promotes mature functioning of the male reproductive organs.

The hormones regulate the development, growth, pubertal maturation and reproductive
processes of the body.

FSH and LH hormones direct spermatogenesis by acting on different types of cells in the
testis.
•	FSH stimulates Sertoli cells to nourish the developing sperm.
•	LH causes Leydig cells to produce testosterone and other androgens to promote
spermatogenesis.
Two negative-feedback mechanisms control sex hormone production in males. 
Testosterone inhibits GnRH, FSH and LH in blood through its effect on the hypothalamus
and anterior pituitary.
Further, inhibin produced by Sertoli cells, acts on anterior pituitary gland to reduce FSH
secretion.
These negative-feedback circuits maintain testosterone and other androgen levels in the
normal range.","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
83,Animal Form and Function - II,Structure and Function of the Human Female Reproductive System,"Main internal structures of the female reproductive system consists of two ovaries (female
gonads), two oviducts, uterus and vagina. 

Ovaries: The female gonads are the two ovaries. They are found on either side of the uterus and
are held in place in the abdominal cavity by ligaments. In the ovary, female gametes are stored
and developed prior to ovulation. Ovaries also produce female sex hormones that are needed for
physiological changes during the reproductive cycle.
The ovaries have two tissue layers: outer the cortex and inner the medulla. The outer layer of each
ovary consists of connective tissues covered by germinal epithelium. The outer layer contains
ovarian follicles in various stages of maturity. Each follicle consists of an oocyte, which is a
partially developed egg surrounded by support cells. Support cells protect and nourish the oocyte
during its development. The ovum is discharged from the ovary at secondary oocyte stage of
oogenesis with the first polar body. This secondary oocyte divides into the mature ovum (egg)
and a second polar body if a sperm penetrates the secondary oocyte. Human ovum is a round cell
with 23 maternal chromosomes and relatively large cytoplasm and is surrounded by numerous
supporting cells. In addition, there is a clear layer present between plasma membrane of the ovum
and the supporting cells (Zona pellucida).

Oviducts: The oviduct or the fallopian tube extends from the uterus toward a funnel like opening
at each ovary. The dimensions of this tube vary along its length (near the uterus is narrow as a
human hair). After ovulation, cilia on the inner epithelial lining of the oviduct help collect the
egg by drawing fluid from the body cavity into the oviduct. Then with the help of wave like
contractions of the oviduct the cilia convey the egg down the oviduct to the uterus.
Uterus: The uterus or the womb is a thick, pear shaped chamber. Its walls are muscular, which
allows it to expand during pregnancy to accommodate the fetus and its inner lining (endometrium)
is highly vascularized. The distal end of the uterus narrows to form a neck, called the cervix that
opens into the vagina.

Vagina: This is a muscular but elastic chamber with a stratified epithelium. The vagina connects
external and internal organs of reproduction. It is the site where sperm is deposited and also serves
as the birth canal.

Oogenesis

In the human female, the development of mature oocytes takes a long time. Immature eggs are
formed in the ovary of a developing female embryo. But these eggs complete their development
many years or even decades later. In oogenesis, cytokinesis during meiosis is unequal, with almost
all the cytoplasm segregated to a single daughter cell. This large cell develops to become the egg.
The other products of meiosis, which are smaller cells are known as polar bodies. These polar
bodies eventually degenerate. Unlike spermatogenesis, the mitotic divisions that occur during oogenesis in human females are thought to be complete before birth and the production of mature
gametes ceases at about the age 50 years. Unlike in spermatogenesis, during oogenesis there are
also long interruptions.

Main steps in oogenesis

Oogenesis begins in the female embryo with the mitotic division of primordial germ cells
that give rise to oogonia.
•	Then oogonia divide by mitosis to form cells that begin meiosis, but stops at prophase I
before birth.
•	Each of these developmentally arrested cells is called a primary oocyte. Each primary oocyte
is found within a small follicle, a cavity lined with protective cells. At birth, the ovaries
together contain about 1-2 million primary oocytes. Out of these about 500 fully mature
between the puberty and menopause.
•	Beginning at puberty, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) periodically stimulates a small
group of follicles to resume growth and development. Out of these only one follicle fully
matures each month. During this time the primary oocyte within the follicle completes
meiosis I and produces a secondary oocyte and the first polar body. Then the meiosis II
starts, but stops at the metaphase.
•	The secondary oocyte arrested in meiosis II is released at ovulation (with the first polar
body), when its follicle breaks open.
•	If a sperm penetrates the secondary oocyte, meiosis II completes and the secondary oocyte
divides into the mature ovum and a second polar body. Both meiotic divisions involve
unequal cytokinesis, with the smaller cells becoming polar bodies which will degenerate
eventually. If a sperm penetrates, there is a single mature egg (ovum) containing a sperm
head at the end of oogenesis. The fusion of the haploid nuclei of the sperm and the ovum
is called fertilization.
•	The ruptured follicle left behind after ovulation develops into the corpus luteum. Corpus
luteum secretes estradiol and progesterone hormones which help to maintain the uterine
lining during pregnancy.
•	If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum degenerates and leaves a small ,permanent
scar of fibrous tissue called corpus albicans on the ovary surface.
•	A new follicle matures during the next cycle. 

Hormonal control of the human female reproductive cycles

Although males produce sperms continuously, females
produce ova in cycles. There are two linked reproductive
cycles in a human female during their reproductive years; {
the ovarian cycle and the uterine cycle (or the menstrual nee
cycle). The uterine cycle consists of changes that occur follicle
about once a month in the uterus and these cyclic changes in. the uterus are controlled by the ovarian . cycle, which is cyclic events that occur in the ovaries. Both of these 4
cycles are regulated by hormonal activities which link 
the two cycles, synchronizing ovarian follicle growth and Q
ovulation with the establishment of a uterine lining which
supports the development of embryo.

1. Ovarian cycle
•	Ovarian cycle comprises follicular phase and luteal phase.
•	The period during which the follicle grows and the oocyte matures is referred to as the
follicular phase. At the beginning of follicular phase, GnRH from the hypothalamus
simulates the anterior pituitary to secrete small amounts of FSH and LH.
•	FSH stimulates follicle growth, aided by LH.
•	Cells of the growing follicle start to make estradiol hormone. Therefore the estradiol level
rises slowly during the follicular phase. The low levels of estradiol inhibit the secretion of
gonadotropin hormones from the anterior pituitary (negative feedback) so that LH and FSH
are kept at relatively low levels in the follicular phase.
•	When estradiol secretion by the growing follicle starts to increase sharply, high levels of
estradiol stimulate the hypothalamus to increase GnRH secretion which in turn stimulates
the anterior pituitary to sharply rise the FSH and LH secretion especially producing a LH
surge (through positive feedback mechanism).
•	By this time the maturing follicle, containing a fluid-filled cavity has enlarged, forming a
bulge at the surface of the ovary. About a day after the LH surge, the follicular phase ends at
ovulation. In response to both FSH and the peak in LH level, the follicle and adjacent wall
of the ovary rupture, releasing the secondary oocyte which is called ovulation.
•	The luteal phase of the ovarian cycle takes place after ovulation. In the luteal phase, LH
stimulates the follicular tissue within the ovary to transform into a glandular structure
called the corpus luteum.
•	The corpus luteum secretes progesterone and estradiol, which then exert negative-feedback
on the hypothalamus and pituitary. This feedback reduces LH and FSH secretion to very
low levels and thereby prevents the maturation of another egg in the ovary.
•	If there is no pregnancy, the low gonadotropin levels at the end of luteal phase promotes
disintegration/ degeneration of the corpus luteum.
•	Disintegration/ degeneration of corpus luteum leads to the sharp decline in production
of its hormones. As a result the negative-feedback of estradiol and progesterone on the
hypothalamus and pituitary are removed. This enables the pituitary to produce FSH to
stimulate the growth of a new follicles thereby starting the next ovarian cycle.

2. Uterine (menstrual) cycle

Uterine cycle consists of proliferative phase, secretory phase and menstrual flow phase.
•	Proliferative phase: Before ovulation, steroid hormones of the ovary stimulate the uterus
to prepare for support of an embryo. Growing follicles secrete estradiol that stimulates the
endometrium to thicken. This is referred to as the proliferative phase in the uterine cycle.
Therefore the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle coordinates with the proliferative phase
of the uterine cycle.
•	The secretory phase starts after ovulation. After ovulation, estradiol and progesterone that
are secreted from the corpus luteum stimulate the maintenance and further development
of the lining of the uterus by enlarging the arteries and growth of the endometrial glands. These glands secrete nutrient fluid that can sustain an early embryo if fertilization occurs.
Hence, the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle is coordinated with the secretory phase of the
uterine cycle.
•	Menstrual flow phase: If implantation of an embryo does not occur, the corpus luteum
disintegrates which results in the drop in ovarian hormones. This brings about the end of
the secretory phase. As a result, arteries constrict and thereby the uterine lining disintegrates
and causes the shedding of endometrial tissues and fluid. This is the menstrual flow phase
of the uterine cycle. The cyclic shedding of the blood-rich endometrium from the uterus, a
process that occurs in a flow and which lasts for a few days through the cervix and vagina
is called menstruation.

Menopause

This is the cessation of ovulation and menstruation in a woman. Usually menopause takes place
between the ages of45 and 55 years. During this time the ovarian supply of oocytes runs out and
the estrogen production by the ovary decreases. Ovaries become less responsive to the hormones
FSH and LH produced by the anterior pituitary ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
84,Animal Form and Function - II,Human Development,"Growth of a new human being starts when an ovum Is fertilized by a sperm usually in the oviduct.
During the development of the individual within the mother’s uterus, a sequence of events occurs
from fertilization to the birth which normally ends in 38 weeks or roughly 9 months. The first
8 weeks of human development is called the embryonic period and thereafter the developing
individual is called a fetus.
•	Fertilization/conception and the formation of a human zygote
During ovulation a secondary oocyte arrested at metaphase I] enters the oviduct. During
fertilization a sperm enters the secondary oocyte penetrating the epithelial cells surrounding
the oocyte, the glycoprotein layer present between the oocyte’s plasma membrane and the
surrounding cells. Once the sperm enters the secondary oocyte, meiosis II of the oocyte
is completed producing the mature ovum. Subsequently, the two haploid pronuclei of
the mature ovum and the sperm fuse to produce a diploid, single cell referred to as the
zygote. The fusion of the haploid nuclei of the sperm and the ovum is called fertilization.
Fertilization takes place in the upper reaches of the oviduct within 12 to 24 hours after
ovulation.
•	Cleavage of the zygote, blastocyst formation and implantation
About 24 hours after fertilization, a series of rapid mitotic cell divisions called ‘cleavage’
take place in the zygote. Cleavage of zygote begins in the oviduct as it moves forward
towards the uterus by ciliary and peristaltic movements. Cleavage continues forming a solid ball of cells (morula) by the time the embryo reaches the uterus (about 3-4 days after
fertilization).

Morula floats within the uterine cavity and gets nutrition by endometrial secretions. About
five days after fertilization, a large fluid filled cavity is formed surrounding the ball of
cells. With the formation of the cavity, this developing stage 1s referred to as the blastocyst.
Further rearrangements of the cells in the blastocyst results in two distinct structures: the
inner cell mass and the trophoblast. Inner cell mass is located internally and eventually
develops into the embryo and the membranes enclosing the embryo which are called the
amniotic sac. The trophoblast which is the outer layer of cells will ultimately develops into
the fetal portion of the placenta.

Around 7 days after fertilization, the blastocyst attaches to the endometrium of the
mother’s uterus. This is called implantation. As the blastocyst implants, the inner cell
mass orients towards the endometrium. The trophoblast grows outward and invades the
endometrium. This is initiated by the enzyme secreted by the trophoblast to breakdown the
uterine lining. Then the trophoblast extends finger like projections into the endometrium.
Trophoblast begins to secrete human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone which has
the action similar to LH. The hormone hCG rescues the corpus luteum from degeneration
and sustains its secretion of progesterone and estrogen which maintain the uterine lining
preventing menstruation.

After implantation, three germ layers are formed in the developing embryo at the end of
the gastrulation stage. Extra-embryonic membranes begin to appear which surround the
embryo. The placenta is formed by the cells of trophoblast and the adjacent endometrial
tissues.

•	Embryonic membranes / fetal membranes
Four new extra embryonic membranes appear after implantation. They are chorion,
amnion, yolk sac and allantois. They provide a life support system for further embryonic/
fetal development.
Chorion becomes the main embryonic portion of the placenta which is the structure for
exchange of materials between the fetus and mother. It also protects the embryo/fetus
from immune responses of the mother. Chorion produces hCG, an important hormone of
pregnancy.
Amnion is a protective membrane surrounding the embryo/fetus creating a fluid filled
cavity which serves as a shock absorber and helps prevent desiccation.
Yolk sac contributes to the cells that will become blood cells until the fetal liver takes over.
It also is the source of primordial germ cells that migrate to the developing gonads.
Allantois is a small outer-pouching of the yolk sac that serves as an early site for blood
formation and its associated with the development of the urinary bladder. 
•	 Placenta and umbilical cord
During the first 2-4 weeks of embryonic development, the embryo obtains nourishment
directly from the endometrium. Eventually, the embryonic trophoblast and the mother’s
endometrium intermingles and form the placenta. The placenta is a disc shaped organ
formed by two parts: embryonic/fetal portion formed by chorionic villi of the chorion
and maternal portion formed by the endometrium. The placenta contains both embryonic/
fetal and maternal blood vessels. However maternal and fetal blood vessels do not join
and the blood they carry do not normally mix. The placenta mediates the exchange of
material (nutrients, respiratory gases, metabolic wastes) between the embryonic/fetal and
the mother’s circulatory systems. The placenta supplies oxygen and nutrients to the fetus
from the maternal blood stream and excrete waste products from the fetus to the maternal
blood stream. The placenta also helps to provide immune protection to the developing
embryo/fetus. The placenta produces hormones (e.g. hCG, progesterone etc.) needed to
sustain the pregnancy.
Umbilical cord is a flexible cord-like structure containing blood vessels and attaches
embryo/fetus to the placenta during gestation. Oxygen poor blood from the embryo/fetus
travels to the placenta through the two arteries of the umbilical cord and passes through
fingerlike projections (chorionic villi) of the placenta where oxygen and nutrients are
acquired. Fetal blood (oxygen rich blood) leaves the placenta through the umbilical vein
leading back to the embryo/fetus. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
85,Animal Form and Function - II,Pregnancy and its duration,"Pregnancy or gestation is the condition of carrying one or more developing offspring inside the
uterus of a female. Human pregnancy period is usually 38 weeks from fertilization to birth or
roughly 9 months (or 40 weeks from the last menstruation to birth). The nine months of pregnancy are divided into three trimesters of about three months each.
During the first trimester, the implanted embryo secretes hormones to regulate the mother’s
reproductive system and to indicate its presence. The hCG hormone secreted by the embryo,
maintains the corpus luteum in the ovary to secrete progesterone and estrogen. Some amount of
this hCG passes from the maternal blood to the urine. The presence of hCG in pregnant mother’s
blood and urine can be easily detected and therefore is used as an early pregnancy detection test.
High levels of progesterone brings about rapid changes in the mother. Both ovulation and
menstrual cycles stop, the maternal side of the placenta grows, and the breasts and the uterus get
larger. Mucus in the cervix of the mother forms a plug which prevents the fetus from infections.
Most mothers experience nausea (morning sickness) during the first trimester.
By the second trimester, the level of hCG declines and as a result the corpus luteum deteriorates.
But the placenta takes over the production of progesterone and estrogens which helps to maintain
the pregnancy. Mother can feel fetal movements. As the fetus grows, mother’s abdominal organs
become compressed and displaced. In the third trimester of pregnancy this may lead to digestive
blockage and frequent urination.

Major fetal changes in each trimester
•	First trimester
The first trimester is the most critical stage of development during which the rudiments of
all major organ systems appear. This is the main period of organogenesis (the development
of the body organs). The heart begins to beat by the 4"" week (can be detected at 8-10
weeks). By the 8""""week, embryo is said to be the fetus as all the parts of an adult are present in rudimentary form. At the end of the 1“ trimester, the fetus is well differentiated and about 5 -7 cm long.
•	Second trimester
By the end of second trimester, the fetus assumes distinctively human features. Organ
systems are completely developed in this stage. During the second trimester, the fetus grows
to about 30 cm in length and is very active so that the mother may feel the fetal movements.
•	Third trimester
The third trimester represents a period of rapid fetal growth. During the early stage of this
period, most of the organ systems become fully functional. During the third trimester, the
fetus grows to about 50 cm in length and weighs about 3-4 kg. Fetal activity decrease as it
fills the space within the uterus.


Maternal immune tolerances of the embryo and fetus

During pregnancy the overall regulation of the mother’s immune system changes. These changes
allow the mother to keep the embryo in her uterus without rejecting as a foreign body even though
half the embryo’s genes are inherited from the father and many chemical markers on the surface
of the embryo are foreign to the mother.

Process of parturition

Child birth begins with the labor. The labor is a series of strong, rhythmic uterine contractions that
push the fetus and placenta out of the body. When labor begins, local regulators (prostaglandins)
and hormones (mainly estradiol and oxytocin) induce and regulate further contractions of the
uterus. This is a positive feedback mechanism as uterine contractions stimulate secretion of
oxytocin which stimulates further contractions of the uterus.
The labor can be divided into three stages. The first stage is the thinning and opening up (dilation)
of the cervix. The second stage is the delivery of the baby. In this stage, continuous and strong
contractions force the fetus out of the uterus and expel through the vagina. Delivery of the
placenta is the final stage of labor.

Lactation

The lactation which is unique to mammals begins as post natal care. Lactation is the secretion
and ejection of mother’s milk from the mammary glands. Lactation is subjected to nervous and
hormonal regulation. The main hormone in promoting milk synthesis and secretion is prolactin. In
response to suckling by the new born baby (which initiates nerve impulses from touch receptors
in the nipples) and decrease in estradiol and progesterone levels in the mother’s blood after
birth, the hypothalamus send impulses to the anterior pituitary to secrete prolactin hormone
which stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk. Suckling also stimulates the secretion of
oxytocin hormone from the posterior pituitary gland and triggers the release (ejection) of milk
from the mammary glands. This is a positive feedback mechanism as milk availability encourages
continuous suckling, so touch sensation on the nipple and oxytocin release continue further
ejecting milk from the mammary glands. 

Composition of human milk and significance of breast feeding

During the first few days after birth, the mammary glands secrete a fluid called ‘colostrum’
until appearance of true milk. Human milk is a sterile solution that contain nutrients such as
lactose, fatty acids, amino acids, minerals, vitamins, and water that are ideal for baby’s digestion,
brain development and growth. Human milk includes proteins such as casein, lactalbumin and
immunoglobulins.
Colostrum and true milk provide nutrients for the baby and contain important antibodies that
protect the infant. Several types of white blood cells are also present in the breast milk which
help the baby to resist microbial infections. Compared to the true milk, colostrum contains less
nutrients (less lactose and no fat) but they are adequate for the early nutritional needs.
Breast feeding supports optimal infant growth, enhances intellectual development and fosters
mother-infant relations by establishing early and prolonged contact between them. Compared to
cow’s milk, the fat, iron and the proteins in the breast milk are more readily metabolized. Lower
sodium content of breast milk is more suited to the baby’s needs. The baby is less likely to have
allergic reactions to mother’s milk than the milk from another source. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
86,Animal Form and Function - II,Birth control methods,"Pregnancy or gestation is the condition of carrying one or more developing offspring inside the
uterus of a female. Human pregnancy period is usually 38 weeks from fertilization to birth or
roughly 9 months (or 40 weeks from the last menstruation to birth). The nine months of pregnancy are divided into three trimesters of about three months each.
During the first trimester, the implanted embryo secretes hormones to regulate the mother’s
reproductive system and to indicate its presence. The hCG hormone secreted by the embryo,
maintains the corpus luteum in the ovary to secrete progesterone and estrogen. Some amount of
this hCG passes from the maternal blood to the urine. The presence of hCG in pregnant mother’s
blood and urine can be easily detected and therefore is used as an early pregnancy detection test.
High levels of progesterone brings about rapid changes in the mother. Both ovulation and
menstrual cycles stop, the maternal side of the placenta grows, and the breasts and the uterus get
larger. Mucus in the cervix of the mother forms a plug which prevents the fetus from infections.
Most mothers experience nausea (morning sickness) during the first trimester.
By the second trimester, the level of hCG declines and as a result the corpus luteum deteriorates.
But the placenta takes over the production of progesterone and estrogens which helps to maintain
the pregnancy. Mother can feel fetal movements. As the fetus grows, mother’s abdominal organs
become compressed and displaced. In the third trimester of pregnancy this may lead to digestive
blockage and frequent urination.

Major fetal changes in each trimester
•	First trimester
The first trimester is the most critical stage of development during which the rudiments of
all major organ systems appear. This is the main period of organogenesis (the development
of the body organs). The heart begins to beat by the 4"" week (can be detected at 8-10
weeks). By the 8""""week, embryo is said to be the fetus as all the parts of an adult are present in rudimentary form. At the end of the 1“ trimester, the fetus is well differentiated and about 5 -7 cm long.
•	Second trimester
By the end of second trimester, the fetus assumes distinctively human features. Organ
systems are completely developed in this stage. During the second trimester, the fetus grows
to about 30 cm in length and is very active so that the mother may feel the fetal movements.
•	Third trimester
The third trimester represents a period of rapid fetal growth. During the early stage of this
period, most of the organ systems become fully functional. During the third trimester, the
fetus grows to about 50 cm in length and weighs about 3-4 kg. Fetal activity decrease as it
fills the space within the uterus.


Maternal immune tolerances of the embryo and fetus

During pregnancy the overall regulation of the mother’s immune system changes. These changes
allow the mother to keep the embryo in her uterus without rejecting as a foreign body even though
half the embryo’s genes are inherited from the father and many chemical markers on the surface
of the embryo are foreign to the mother.

87,Animal Form and Function - II,Support and Movement,"The structure and functions of the skeletal systems of animals

In the animal kingdom, three major types of skeletons are found. They are hydrostatic skeletons,
exoskeletons and endoskeletons.

Hydrostatic skeleton is a fluid filled body cavity which is enclosed by the body wall. In cnidarians,
gastrovascular cavity acts as the hydrostatic skeleton. In some animals such as nematodes and
annelids, the fluid filled cavity enclosed by the body wall (e.g., pseudocoelom in Nematoda,
coelom in Annelida) consists of two muscle layers (longitudinal and circular muscles) which act
antagonistically. The combined effect of muscle contraction and fluid pressure aids in locomotion
and maintain the shape and form of the animal. In many animals, the spaces between cells are
filled with fluid called interstitial fluid which provides support to these cells.

Exoskeleton its a rigid outer covering of the body of the animal which acts as a skeleton. Different
types of exoskeletons are seen in the animal kingdom: Chitinous exoskeleton, calcium carbonate
exoskeleton and bony plates. Arthropods possess the exoskeleton which is mainly composed
of a non-cellular material, chitin. The chitinous exoskeleton is hardened by proteins or calcium
carbonate. Exoskeletons that are made up of calcium carbonate are seen in the mollusks. In some
reptiles, bony plates serve as the exoskeleton.

Endoskeleton 1s a hard skeleton which is buried in the soft tissues of the animal. Different types
of endoskeletons are seen in the animal kingdom. These include plates of calcium carbonate (in
echinodermates), bones and cartilage (in chordates).

Common functions of the skeletal systems in animals
•	Support — All skeletons provide a rigid framework for the body and are resistant to
compression and tension forces. They help to maintain the shape of body.
•	Protection — The skeleton protects the delicate internal organs.
•	Movement — Most skeletons are composed of rigid materials which provide surface by
means of attachment for the muscles of the body. Parts of the skeleton operate as levers on
which the muscles can pull. When this occurs, movement takes place.

Functions of the human skeletal systems
•	Support
•	Protection
•	Movement 
The human skeleton
Human skeleton is divided into two main parts: axial skeleton and appendicular skeleton.
•	Axial skeleton consists of skull, vertebral column, sternum and ribs.
•	Appendicular skeleton consists of girdles (pectoral and pelvic) and limb bones. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
88,Animal Form and Function - II,Organization of the human axial skeletal system,"Skull
In humans, the skull rests on the upper end of the vertebral column. The human skull
consists of 22 bones which are mostly connected together by ossified joints (sutures).
Skull is divided into the cranium (brain case) and the face. The bones in the cranium are
the frontal bone, two parietal bones, the occipital bone, two temporal bones, the ethmoid
bone and the sphenoid bone. In addition to the frontal bone, fourteen other bones form
the skeleton of the face. They are two zygomatic bones (cheek bones),fused two maxillae
(united to form the upper jaw bone), two nasal bones, two lacrimal bones, the vomer, two
palatine bones, two inferior conchae and the mandible (lower jaw bone)

Cranium region
Human cranial capacity is nearly 1.5 L. Cranium protects and encloses the brain. It also
protects the inner ear, middle ear, olfactory organs and eyes. Bony eye sockets provide
attachment to the eye muscles that move them. On the inferior surface of the cranium there is
foramen magnum to provide passage to spinal cord. Two smooth rounded knobs (Occipital
condyles) on either side of the foramen magnum articulates with the first vertebrae (atlas
vertebrae) which permits nodding movements.
In the cranium, soft membranous regions called fontanelles are present which allow slight
compressions at birth facilitating parturition. Fontanelles become replaced by bones within
1-2 years of life. Immovable joints (sutures) are present between the skull bones to provide
more protection. Several air filled cavities lined by ciliated mucous membrane are present
in the skull (in the sphenoid, ethmoid, maxillary and frontal bones). They are called sinuses.
They all communicate with the nasal cavity. Sinuses provide resonance to voice and reduce
the weight of the skull.

Facial region
Facial region is situated below the cranium. Some facial bones form the walls of the posterior
part of the nasal cavity and form the upper part of the air passages. Maxilla and mandible
provide ridges in which teeth are embedded. Upper jaw (maxilla) is fused with cranium.
Lower jaw (mandible) is movable. Hard palate (bony) and soft palate (cartilaginous)
separate the buccal cavity from nasal cavity. Lower jaw articulates with the cranium.
Zygomatic arch (formed from parts of zygomatic bone and temporal bone) provides the
surface for muscular attachment for moving the lower jaw. Lower jaw (mandible) contains
two processes: Condyloid process which articulates with the temporal bone to form the
temporal-mandibular joint; Coronoid process which gives attachment to muscles and the
ligaments. At the base of the skull, occipital condyles (1 pair) are present on occipital
bone to form a hinge joint with atlas vertebrae. Temporal bone contains three processes:
zygomatic process (which forms part of the zygomatic arch), mastoid process and styloid
process. They provide surfaces for muscle attachment. 

Vertebral column
Vertebral column is a strong flexible rod consisting of 26 linearly arranged bones. It consists
of 24 separate vertebrae extending downwards from the occipital bone of the skull, the
sacrum (formed from 5 fused vertebrae) and coccyx (formed from 4 small fused vertebrae).
The vertebral column is divided into different regions. There are 4 distinct regions: cervical
spine (formed by 7 vertebrae in the neck), thoracic spine (formed by next 12 vertebrae),
lumbar spine (formed by next 5 vertebrae), and the sacrum to which the lowest vertebrae of
lumbar spine is articulated; the coccyx is situated at the end.

Curvatures of the vertebral column

In humans, there are four curves in the vertebral column: cervical, thoracic, lumbar and
sacral. They can be categorized into two main types: two primary curvatures and two
secondary curvatures. Main function of the curvatures is the maintenance of the erect
posture.
Primary curvatures: In the fetus, there is only one curvature in the vertebral column. When
secondary curvatures are formed the primary curvature is retained only in thoracic and
sacral regions which are known as primary curvatures. They are concave anteriorly.
Secondary curvatures: Formed after birth, the first cervical curvature develops at about
03 months of birth. Then the child can hold his head upright. Second, lumbar curvature
develops when the child is around 7-8 months. Then the child can hold his body upright.
These secondary curvatures are convex towards the anterior. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
89,Animal Form and Function - II,Types of vertebrae,"Structure of a typical vertebra

A lumbar vertebra can be considered a typical vertebra. A typical vertebra consists of the
body and the vertebral arch. The body is the largest, broad and flattened part of the vertebrae.
The flattened surface of the body of each vertebra articulates with the corresponding surface
of the adjacent vertebra so that vertebrae are stacked together in the vertebral column. However
the adjacent two vertebrae are not in direct contact with each other as there is a tough pad of
cartilage called intervertebral disc between the two vertebrae. The size of the body of the vertebra
increases downwards of the vertebral column to support the body weight.
Vertebral arch encloses vertebral foramen which provides passage way for the spinal cord.
Processes arising from the neural arch provide surfaces for muscle attachment. Two lateral
processes are called transverse processes and the posterior process is called spinous process.
The vertebral arch has four articular surfaces: two superior articular surfaces (articulate with
the adjacent vertebrae above) and two inferior articular surfaces .
Region specific vertebral characteristics

Cervical vertebrae: Cervical vertebrae are the first seven vertebrae in the vertebral column.
When compared to the other types of vertebra, cervical vertebrae are the smallest. Body
of the cervical vertebra is smaller compared to the other vertebrae. In addition, transverse
processes of a cervical vertebra have a foramen on each side to provide passage for the
vertebral artery. The spinous process of most of these vertebrae is bifid . The first cervical vertebra is the atlas which is the bone on which the skull rests. It is a ring shaped
vertebra with no distinct body or spinous processes. It has two short transverse processes. The
atlas contains two flattened facets which articulate with the occipital bone of the skull (condyloid
joints), permitting nodding movements. Vertebral foramen of this vertebra is relatively larger to
provide the passage of the larger upper part of the spinal cord. The second cervical vertebra is the axis. It has a small body with a superior projections called
odontoid process which articulates with the atlas vertebra above. The head pivots (turns on side
to side) on this joint. 

Thoracic vertebra: The twelve thoracic vertebrae are larger than cervical vertebrae as this
region of the vertebral column has to support more body weight. The body and transverse
processes of thoracic vertebrae have facets for articulation with the ribs 

Lumbar vertebrae: The five lumbar vertebrae are the largest of the vertebrae because they
have to support the weight of the upper body. The size of the body of the lumbar vertebrae
is larger compared to the other vertebrae. For attachment of the muscles of lower back, the
lumbar vertebrae have relatively large spinal processes.

Sacrum and Coccyx: Sacrum is a triangular shaped large bone consisting of five fused
rudimentary vertebrae. It has a concave anterior surface. The upper part articulates with
the fifth lumbar vertebrae. On each side, sacrum articulates with the pelvic girdle. Inferior
tip of the sacrum articulates with coccyx. A series of vertebral foramina are present on each
side for passage of nerves. Coccyx consists of fused four terminal vertebrae to form a small
triangular bone. The broad base of the coccyx articulates with the tip of the sacrum.
Common functions of the human vertebral column
The vertebral column helps to maintain the erect posture. It supports the skull and articulates to
ribs and girdles. It also provides the protection for the spinal cord. Vertebral foramens provide
spaces for spinal nerves and blood vessels and lymph vessels. The vertebral column allows
flexibility in the body movements. The intervertebral discs act as shock absorbers and protect the
spinal cord.

Sternum

Sternum is a long flat bone that forms anterior part of the thoracic cage (which is made up of
sternum, ribs and thoracic vertebrae). The uppermost section of the sternum is the manubrium
which articulates with the clavicles in the pectoral girdles and the first two pairs of ribs. The
body, which is the middle part of the sternum gives attachment to the rest of the ribs. The xiphoid
process is the tip of the bone which gives attachment to the diaphragm and muscles of the anterior abdominal wall. The sternum provides protection to the organs and blood vessels that lie behind
it (heart and lungs) from physical damage. The red bone marrow in the sternum is one of the main
sites for production of blood cells.

Ribs

The twelve pairs of ribs form the lateral walls of the thoracic cage. They are elongated curved
bones. They articulate posteriorly with the thoracic vertebrae of the vertebral column. Anteriorly
7 pairs of ribs articulate with the sternum (true ribs), next 3 pairs articulate with sternum indirectly.
In both cases costal cartilages attach the ribs to the sternum. The lowest 2 pairs do not join
the sternum (floating ribs). Head of the rib articulates with vertebral bodies, facets of tubercle
articulate with transverse process of vertebrae. The thoracic cage which includes the ribs and
sternum plays an important role in the mechanism of breathing. Between each ribs intercostal
muscles are present which move the rib cage during breathing. The first rib is firmly fixed to the
sternum and to the first thoracic vertebra. Therefore it does not move during inspiration. Because
it is a fixed point when the intercostal muscle contract they pull the entire rib cage upwards and
towards the first ribs. Presence of 12 pairs of ribs and sternum provides protection to the organs
such as lungs and heart in the thoracic cavity.

Contribution of human axial skeleton to maintain the upright posture
•	 Presence of two primary curvatures and two secondary curvatures in the vertebral column.
Development of the two secondary curvatures in the vertebral column mainly contribute to
maintain the erect posture. (Refer the section on curvatures of vertebral column).
•	The size of the vertebrae (especially the body of the vertebrae) become larger towards the
end of the vertebral column as they have to support the weight of the upper body (Refer the
section on vertebrae). 
•	The sacral vertebrae are fused to form a triangular shaped large sacrum to support the
weight of the vertebral column and internal organs of the body.
•	The two occipital condyles and the foramen magnum are located inferiorly at the base
of the skull close to the center. In the upright position, this arrangement permits proper
balancing of the skull on the vertebral column. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
90,Animal Form and Function - II,The structure and functions of the human appendicular skeleton,"Appendicular skeleton

The appendicular skeleton consists of upper limbs with pectoral (shoulder) girdle and lower
limbs with the pelvic girdle. Through the pectoral girdle the upper limb forms the joints with the
trunk. Pectoral girdle connects upper limb with the axial skeleton. Pectoral girdle consists of two
scapulae (shoulder blades) and two clavicles (collar bones). The lower limb forms a joint with
the trunk at the pelvic girdle. Pelvic girdle is formed from two hip bones and it is associated with
the sacrum. 

Upper limb
Upper limb consists of humerus (bone of the upper arm), radius and ulna (bones in the fore arm),
eight carpal bones (wrist bones) , five metacarpal bones (in the palm) and fourteen phalanges
(bones of the digits). 

The adaptation of the human upper limb for movement through a wide range.

Structure of upper limb is adapted for grasping, weight lifting and movement over a wide range.
Head of the humerus (the bone of the upper arm) forms an incomplete ball and socket joint
(shoulder joint) in glenoid cavity of the scapula permitting a vast range of movements. The joint
allows for flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, rotation and circumduction.
The distal end of the humerus has two articular surfaces. Through these surfaces, radius and ulna
articulate with the humerus at the elbow joint. They articulate with the carpal bones at the wrist
joint. Further ulna and radius are articulated with each other at the proximal and distal radioulnar joints. In addition a fibrous joint connects the bones along their shafts which stabilize their
association and maintain their relative position in spite of forces applied from the elbow or wrist.
The elbow joint acts as a hinge joint which permits only flexion and extension of the forearm. 

The carpal bones which are arranged in two rows (proximal row and distal row) are closely fitted
together so that there is limited amount of movement between them. Proximal row bones are
associated with the wrist joint and distal row bones form joints with metacarpal bones. Wrist joint
is present between the distal end of radius and three proximal carpal bones. This arrangement
allows pronation (turning palm down) and supination (turning palm up) of the lower part of the
upper limb. In addition the wrist can be flexed, extended, abducted and adducted.
The proximal ends of metacarpal bones in the palm articulate with carpal bones and their distal
ends articulate with phalanges. The joints between metacarpal and phalanges allow movement
of the fingers and permit the power grip. Fingers may be flexed extended, adducted, abducted
and circumducted with the first finger more flexible than the other. The joint present at the base of
the thumb between a specific carpal bone and the first metacarpal bone allows more mobility to
the thumb than the other fingers. This leads to opposable nature of the thumb which permits the
thumb to move perpendicular to the other fingers. This articulation permits precision grip which
is unique to man.

Lower limb

Lower limb consists of femur (thigh bone), tibia (shin bone), fibula, patella (knee cap), seven
tarsal bones (ankle bones), five metatarsal bones (bones of the foot) and fourteen phalanges (toe
bones).

Adaptations of the lower limb for the erect posture, bearing of body weight and
walking

Femur is the longest, heaviest and the strongest bone of the body. Head of the femur forms the hip
joint (ball and socket joint) with the acetabulum of the hipbone of the pelvis. This hip joint is very
sturdy and powerful as it bears all body weight when standing. The lower limb can be extended,
flexed, abducted, adducted, rotated and circumducted at the hip joint.
Lower end of femur articulates with tibia and patella to form the knee joint. Tibia is the medial
of the two bones. Possible movements at the knee joint are flexion, extension and a rotatory
movement that locks the joint when it is fully extended. When this joint is locked it is possible to
stand upright fora long period of time.

Femur transmits the weight of the body through the bones below the knee to the foot. All the
lower ends of both tibia and fibula articulate with a specific tarsal bone to form the ankle joint.
The ankle joint allows rising in tip toe and lifting toes towards the calf.

The arrangement of bones in the foot supported by associated ligaments and muscles gives the
sole of the foot an arch Edora curved shape. The bones of the foot are arranged in two arches; the
longitudinal arch and the transverse arch. Curve running heel to toe is called the longitudinal arch
and the curve running across the foot is called the transverse arch. In the upright position, these
arches of the foot are important in distributing the weight of the body evenly whether stationary
or moving. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
91,Animal Form and Function - II,Some disorders and abnormalities associated with human skeletal system,"Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a condition associated with the reduction of bone density due to the exceedance
of the bone reabsorption rate over the deposition rate. This gives in fragility to the bone tissue.
This condition leads to immobility in joints and may cause fractures, skeletal deformities and
bone pain. Factors causing osteoporosis include hormonal imbalances (especially at menopause),
calcium deficiency and environmental factors.
Osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis is a degenerative non-inflammatory disease that causes pain and restricted
movements in the affected joints. Articular cartilage at the joints gradually become thinner so
that articular surfaces of the bones come in contact and eventually the bones begin to degenerate;
the outcome is pain. The cause of osteoarthritis is unknown. But risk factors include excessive use
of affected joints, female gender, aging, heredity and obesity.


Slipped disc
The bodies of adjacent vertebrae are separated by intervertebral discs which serve as shock
absorbers. These intervertebral discs consist of an outer ring of cartilage and a central core of soft
gelatinous material. An injury or weakness can cause the inner portion of the intervertebral disc
to protrude through the outer ring. This condition is called ‘slipped disc’. This leads to pain and
discomfort. If the slipped disc compresses a spinal nerve, there can be numbness and pain along
the affected nerve. Slipped disc condition can arise when lifting heavy weights without bending
knees. 

Main types of joints in the human skeletal system

Main types of the joints in the human skeletal system are ball and socket joint, hinge joint and
pivot joint.
•	Ball and socket joints
In these joints, ball shaped head is connected with the cup shaped socket and allows for
wide range movements such as flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, rotation and
circumduction. There are two ball and socket joints available in the human body: Shoulder
joint and hip joint. (Refer upper limb and lower limb)
•	Hinge Joints
The articulating ends of the bone fit together in such a way so it looks like a hinge of a door.
This allows only restricted movements such as flexion and extensions. Examples for hinge
joints are elbow joint, knee joint, ankle joint and joints between the phalanges of the fingers
and toes. (Refer upper limb and lower limb)
•	Pivot joints
One bone fits into a hoop shaped ligament that holds it close to another bone and allows it
to rotate in the ring formed by the ligament. These joints allow a bone or limb to rotate. For
example head rotates by the pivot joint formed by the atlas vertebrae within the transverse
ligament ring and odontoid process of the axis. (Refer vertebral column)
Skeletal muscle and mechanism of contraction

Features of skeletal muscle tissue

The skeletal muscles are generally attached to the skeletal system and mainly cause voluntary
body movements. Skeletal muscle tissue is composed of bundles of long cylindrical cells. These
cells are aligned parallel to each other along the length of the muscle. Each cell contain multiple
nuclei close to the cell membrane. Inside the cell, bundles of myofibrils containing contractile
microfilaments are located longitudinally along the length of the cell. Myofibrils in the muscle
cell form by repeating sections called sarcomeres. The repeating arrangement of sarcomeres
within the skeletal muscle cell gives its striated appearance under the microscope. Sarcomeres
are the basic contractile units of the striated muscle cell. Like smooth muscle cells and cardiac
muscle cells, skeletal muscle cells show excitability or irritability (ability to receive and respond
to stimuli), contractility (ability to contract or shorten), extensibility (ability to stretch or contract)
and elasticity (ability to return to its original length after being stretched or contracted). The
skeletal muscle is under the voluntary control of the somatic nervous system. 

Structure of the sarcomere, basic mechanism of skeletal muscle movement
Sarcomeres are the repeating contractile units present within a striated muscle cell. The Myofibrils
is composed of contractile thick filaments and thin filaments which are made up of specific proteins.
The thin filaments (formed mainly from actin protein) attached at the Z line, a dense stripe which
forms the borders of the sarcomere. The thick filaments (formed from myosin protein) are fixed
(at the M line) in the middle region of the sarcomere. Sarcomeres are found repeatedly between
two Z lines in a skeletal muscle cell. At the resting stage of myofibrils, thick and thin filaments are
partially overlapped. At the edge of the sarcomere there are only thin filaments while at the center
of the sarcomere only thick filaments are present. Such arrangement of thick and thin filaments in
the sarcomeres permits the shortening of the skeletal muscle cell during contraction and return to
the original state during relaxation. The mechanical function arising from sarcomeres is produced
by actin and myosin proteins.
The skeletal muscle contraction is mainly voluntary and under the control of the somatic
nervous system. Upon stimulation, individual muscle cells in the skeletal muscle shortens
due to the shortening of its sarcomeres, and thus the whole muscle may contract. Converting
muscle contraction to movement needs a skeleton to which the muscles attach. Skeletal muscle
contractions pull on the tendons attached to the bones. If contraction of the muscle causes the
muscle to shorten, the bone and the body part will move. When the nervous stimulation is stopped,
the muscles will return to the original length after being contracted ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
92,Genetics,Vocabulary in genetics,"self or cross pollination between these F1 generation plants is known as F, generation (Second
Filial generation).
An organism that is heterozygous with respect to a single gene of interest resulting from a cross
between parents having homozygous condition for different alleles of specific gene is referred to
as a 'monohybrid’. Breeding experiments conducted between two organisms with heterozygous
condition for a specific character is referred to as ‘monohybrid cross’.
An organism that is heterozygous with respect to two genes of interest resulting from a cross between parents having homozygous conditions for different alleles of two specific genes is referred to as a
‘dihybrid'. Breeding experiment conducted between two organisms with heterozygous conditions
for two specific characters is referred to as a ‘dihybrid cross’.
Breeding an organism having unknown genotype for a specific dominant trait with an organism
having homozygous recessive condition for the same specific trait is called a test cross. This is
usually done to reveal the unknown genotypes for specific dominant traits in an organism.

Monohybrid Cross
Mendel derived his first law of inheritance by following only a single character in one breeding
experiment, such as flower color. He started by crossing pure breeding parents with contrasting
traits. All the F, progeny produced from pure breeding parents are monohybrids, meaning that
they are heterozygous for the particular character being followed in the cross. Mendel, during his experiment, crossed pure breeding purple flowered plants and white flowered
plants. Then he allowed the resulting F, hybrids to self and cross-pollinate with other F, hybrids.
Finally, he observed the F, generation plants for the color of the flowers.
During his observation, all F , plants produced purple color flowers. However, in the F, generation,
both purple and white flowered plants appeared in a ratio of approximately 3: 1. Among the heterozygote resulted in the F, generation, the “heritable factor” responsible for
producing white flowers were suppressed in presence of the ""heritable factor"" that produces purple
flowers. As a result, the heterozygotes were all producing purple color flowers. Therefore, the
‘heritable factor’ for purple flower color is dominant to the white (dominant trait). Accordingly,
the factor for white flower color is referred as the recessive trait.
Mendel observed that the same pattern of inheritance consistently occurred in six other characters;
position of the flower, color of the seed, shape of the seed, shape of the pod, color of the pod
and the length of the stem. 

Mendel’s first law of inheritance: The law of segregation

Mendel’s first law was put forward to explain the 3:1 inheritance pattern observed among the F,
offspring in his monohybrid experiments using Pea plants.
As per his hypothesis, each ‘heritable character’ is determined by two ""heritable factors"" which
are known as alleles. During the formation of gametes, the alleles for a ‘heritable character’ are
separated and get in to each of the gametes formed. This is now known as Mendel’s law of
segregation or Mendel’s first law in inheritance.

Analyzing genotype and phenotype ratios using Punnett square

In Pea plants, Mendel observed two different traits based on stem lengths; tall and dwarf. For
his experiments, pure breeding tall and dwarf Pea plants were selected for cross pollination.
Thereafter the F, generation was self pollinated in order to obtain F, generation.
During self pollination of F, hybrids, gametes carrying different alleles fuse randomly. Such
random fusion of gametes produces zygotes with four genetic combinations. A Punnett square can
be used to illustrate these genetic combinations. A Punnett square is a graphical representation
of the possible genotypes of an offspring arising from a particular cross or breeding event. 

Dihybrid Cross

Mendel identified his second law of inheritance by following two characters at the same time,
using dihybrid crosses. A cross between two heterozygous organisms with contrasting traits for
two specific characters being followed is known as a dihybrid. Breeding experiment conducted
between two organisms with heterozygous conditions for two specific characters is referred to as
a ‘dihybrid cross’. The aim of the Mendel's dihybrid cross experiment was to find out whether
the alleles for one character assort into gametes dependently or independently of the alleles of the
other character.
Mendel crossed a true-breeding plant with yellow-round seeds with a true breeding plant with
green-wrinkled seeds (Figure 6.3). The cross produced dihybrid F, plants, all of which have
yellow-round seeds. As shown by the monohybrid crosses, the allele for yellow seeds is dominant
(Y) over the allele for green seeds (y) which is recessive. likewise, the allele for round seed is
dominant (R), and the allele for wrinkled seed is recessive (r). The F, hybrids, are heterozygous for
the two characters being followed in the cross (YyRr). The cross between F, dihybrids produced
the F, generation.  This lead towards two alternative hypothesis for inheritance which predict different phenotypic
ratios 
1. | The two characters could be transmitted from parents to offspring as a package. The
dominant Y and R alleles or the recessive y and r alleles are passed together, generation
after generation. This is called dependent assortment of alleles.
According to this hypothesis only two types of gametes are possible; i.e. YR and yr. Thus
the phenotypic ratio of the F, generation would be similar to that of a monohybrid cross
(3:1)
2. The two characters (seed colour and seed shape) could be transmitted from parents to
offspring independent of each other i.e. Y allele could be passed either with R or r allele
vice versa. This is called independent assortment of alleles.
This hypothesis predicts four different allelic combinations for a bi-allelic locus and thus
four different types of gametes from F, generation; i.e., YR, Yr, yR and yr. According to
this, both male and female gametes have four possibilities for each. Therefore, during the
union of male and female gametes, there are 16 (4 x 4) equally probable ways in which the
alleles can combine to produce the F, generation. As shown in Figure 3, these combinations
would give rise to four different phenotypes with a ratio of 9:3:3:1 (nine Yellow round to
three Green-round to three Yellow-wrinkled to one Green-wrinkled). 

Mendel’s experiment produced the four distinct phenotypes (Yellow-round, Green-round,
Yellow-wrinkled and Green-wrinkled seeds) predicted in the second alternative hypothesis in the
ratio of 9:3:3:1. This showed that, the alleles responsible for each trait assorted independently of
those of the other.

Mendel’s second law of inheritance (The law of independent assortment)

Based on these experiments, Mendel put forward his second law of inheritance - the law of
independent assortment. The law states that, alleles separate and pair up independently during
the formation of gametes. As a result of that, two or more genes assort independently irrespective
of the other.
However, according to current knowledge, this condition applies to two circumstances only;
•	To genes located on different chromosomes (genes on non-homologous chromosomes)
•	To genes located far apart on the same chromosome ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
93,Genetics,Success of Mendel’s experiments,"Mendel followed a scientific approach in conducting his experiments. The following features in
his experiments helped him to unravel the two fundamental principles of heredity.
•	 Mendel carried out thousands of genetic crosses of any given kind. This allowed his results
to closely resemble the probability predictions. Usually, the larger the sample size, the
closer the results to the value predicted based on the probability.
•	He kept accurate records of his results. These records helped him to trace the patterns
which otherwise would go unnoticed.
•	He usually followed up each cross for at least two offspring generations (F, and F,). This
helped him to uncover some of the traits hidden in the F, generation.
•	He did a quantitative analysis of the phenotypes of the resulting offspring.

Desirable properties in garden peas for genetic experiments

Garden peas (Pisum sativum) carry following desirable properties which makes it a suitable
organism to study patterns of inheritance.
•	Pea plants are available in many varieties with contrasting traits.
•	The generation time is short.
•	A large number of offspring is produced from each cross.
•	Crossing between the plants could be strictly controlled (self? cross pollination).

Probability laws and Mendelian inheritance
Mendel’s laws of segregation and independent assortment reflect the same rules of probability
that applies to tossing coins, rolling dice, and drawing cards from a deck. Probability measures how likely an event is to occur out of the number of possible outcomes. It is calculated by dividing
the number of events of interest by the number of total possible outcomes.
1. The probability scale ranges from 0 to 1.
An event that is certain to occur has a probability of 1, while an event that is certain not
to occur has a probability of 0.
During allele segregation in a F, plant (heterozygous) of a monohybrid cross,
-probability of each egg carrying the dominant allele = 1/2
-probability of each egg carrying the recessive allele = 1/2
2. The probabilities of all possible outcomes for an event add up to 1.
During allele segregation in a heterozygous F, plant, probability of all events
(having dominant and recessive alleles) = 1/2 +1/2= 1
3.  When the occurrence of an event does not affect the occurrence of another event
(independent events), the probability of simultaneous occurrence of both events can
be obtained by multiplying the probability of one event by the probability of the other
event. This is known as the Multiplication Rule or Product rule in Probability.
In Mendel’s monohybrid crosses, for a F, plant to have wrinkled seeds (rr), both
the egg and the sperm that come together must carry the r allele.
The probability that the egg will have an r = 1/2
The probability that the sperm will have an r= 1/2
The probability of both gametes at fertilization carrying r allele = ½ X ½ = 1/4
4. The probability that any one of two or more mutually exclusive events will occur is
calculated by adding their individual probabilities. This is the addition rule or sum rule
of probability.
There are two possible mutually exclusive ways for producing F, heterozygotes.
i The dominant allele come from the egg and the recessive allele from the
sperm; the probability of the event = 1/4 (according to example in above 3rd
sentence)
ii. The recessive allele from the egg and the dominant allele from

the sperm; the probability of the event = 1/4(according to example in above
3rd sentence)
So, the probability of getting an F, heterozygote = 1/4+ 1/4 =1/2
Prediction of the inheritance patterns in multifactorial crosses
When the pattern of inheritance of two or more characters of an organism is being traced during a
genetic cross, it could be called as multifactorial cross. Finding out the outcomes of a multifactorial
cross through a Punnett square may be a difficult task. Therefore, applying rules of probability
may be useful to predict the outcomes of a multifactorial crossing. 

The testcross

This is a deliberate breeding process performed in order to determine the unknown genotypes. The genotype of an individual showing dominant trait may be due either to double dominant genotype
or to heterozygous status. This involves the crossing of an organism having unknown genotype
for a selected phenotype along with another organism from same species having homozygous
recessive condition for same character.
Testcross performed during the monohybrid cross is called as monohybrid testcross. On the other
hand, test cross performed during the dihybrid cross is called as dihybrid testcross.
Monohybrid testcross
Let’s consider an example for monohybrid testcross. In this example we want to know the
genotype of the given tall pea plants. In order to do that, we will cross the tall pea plant with the
dwarf pea plant. Since dwarf is a recessive trait the genotype of it will be tt.
There may be two possible genotypes for tall pea plants;
I. TT
2 Tt
Assume that unknown pea plant is having genotype of TT 

Dihybrid testcross

When an individual with dominant traits for two characters (e.g. RrBb) is crossed with a pure
recessive for both characters (rrbb), it is known as a dihybrid testcross.
For example, let’s consider a cross between plants having red coloured flower petals with black
coloured seeds and white coloured flower petals with brown coloured seeds.
The possible genotypes for red coloured petals with black coloured seeds are RrBb/ RRBb/RrBB/
RRBB and for white coloured petals with brown coloured seeds is rrbb.
If the unknown phenotype is RrBb; ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
94,Genetics,Patterns of inheritance of Mendelian characteristics in humans,"Common Mendelian characters

Many human traits follow Mendelian patterns of inheritance. Some common examples are stated
below;
Attached or detached earlobe:
The extent to which the earlobe is attached to the head is inherited in the Mendelian pattern. The attached earlobe is a recessive trait. Presence of both copies of the recessive allele (homozygous
recessive condition) for ear lobe attachment would result in attached ear lobe.

Widow’s peak:
The pointed contour of the hairline on the forehead is known as Widow’s peak. It is due to a
dominant allele, W. Therefore, all individuals who lack a widow’s peak must be homozygous
recessive (ww).

Dimples on cheek:
Cheek dimples are a genetically transmitted trait found in the muscle of the cheek.
When a person smiles, the shorter muscle on the face pulls up the facial skin. This, in turn, creates a slight depression in the skin, which is called dimple. Dimples often occur on both the cheeks.
A single dimple on one cheek is a rare phenomenon. Dimple is a dominant trait and inherited in
Mendelian fashion.

Bent thumb (Hitchhiker's thumb) and Straight thumb
Hitchhiker's thumbs is a condition where thumb bend backwards while stretching due to the hyper extensibility of interphalangeal joints. Having the dominant ‘S’ allele would produce the dominant
phenotype of straight thumb. The absence of the dominant alleles would allow the thumb to bend.

Rolling or non-rolling tongue
The ability to roll the lateral edges of the tongue upwards into a tube is known as tongue rolling.
The tongue's intrinsic muscles allow some people to form their tongues into specific shapes.
Rolling the tongue into a tube shape is a dominant trait with simple Mendelian inheritance.

Pedigree analysis
Diagrammatic representation of the inheritance of a particular trait within a given family tree, is
called pedigree chart. It is constructed by collecting data for many generations within a given
family, so that the pattern of inheritance can be understood. 

Common Mendelian characteristics in humans analyzed with pedigree charts

Widow’s peak:

The inheritance of the trait, widow's peak, over three generations in a particular family is
represented in the pedigree chart given below. As shown in figure 6.7, only one grand parent had
widow's peak, out of the two pairs. Since widow's peak is a dominant character, grand parents
without widow's peak should be homozygous recessive (ww) for the trait. In the next generation
some individuals showed the widow's peak, while the others did not. The two grand parents, who
express the widow's peak should be heterozygous (Ww) for the condition . Likewise, the two
parents of the third generation, who are showing widow's peak should be heterozygous for it, as
one of both their parents (1* generation) are homozygous recessive (ww). the third generation
with widow's peak can carry either WW or Ww genotype, as both their parents are having the
trait.

Attached earlobe

Attached earlobe, as explained earlier, isa recessively inherited character. In the pedigree chart given below, the in hesitance of the trait is analyzed in the same family that was used to study the widow's peak. The dominant allele, which is causing the free ear lobe is denoted with 'F' while recessive allele is denoted with 'fi. 
n the first generation, both parents lacking the attachment of ear lobes, resulted mixed progenies
with attached and free ear lobes. This tells us that those two parents were heterozygous (Ff), and
among the progeny, two males with attached ear lobes carry homozygous recessive alleles (ff)
and a male and female with free ear lobe may carry heterozygous (Ff) or homozygous dominant
alleles (FF). Another cross happened at the first generation between a male with attached ear lobe and a female with free ear lobe. This resulted one daughter with attached ear lobe. Therefore, she must possess ff and the other must be Ff. A male from one family and a female from another
family, at the second generation expressing free ear lobe phenotype, had resulted progeny having
two females, one with attached ear lobes and the other with free ear lobes for the third generation.
Therefore, the second generation male and female crossed with free year lobes must be Ff. Third
generation female with attached car lobes must carry ff genotype and the other may carry either
FF or Ff.
The probability that another child from the same family will have attached earlobes could be
calculated using a monohybrid cross (Ff x Ff). Since homozygous recessive (ff) genotype is
causing the condition, the probability is 14 for each child.
The chance that a child born to the family will have both the widow’s peak and attached earlobes
can be calculated using probability rules. Assuming that the alleles corresponding to the two characters are on different chromosomes, the two pairs of alleles assort independently in this
dihybrid cross (WwFf X WwFf).","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
95,Genetics,Non-Mendelian inheritance,"Non-Mendelian inheritance refers to inheritance patterns in which traits do not segregate in
accordance with Mendel's laws of inheritance. Phenotypes that do not appear in ratios predicted
by Mendelian genetics are the indicators of Non-Mendelian inheritance.
Examples for non-mendelian patterns
•	when alleles are not completely dominant or recessive (incomplete dominance and codominance),
•	when a particular gene has more than two alleles (polyallelism)
•	when a single gene produces multiple phenotypes (pleiotropy)
•	sometimes two or more genes are involved in determining a particular phenotype (epistasis
and polygenic inheritance)
•	gene linkage
•	genes which are located in sex chromosomes exhibit a different pattern of inheritance in
males and females due to the unequal distribution of genes in their sex chromosomes.
Incomplete dominance
The phenomenon of dominant allele completely masking the recessive phenotype, resulting
similar phenotypes for both homozygous dominant zygote as well as heterozygous zygote is
called complete dominance.

On the other hand, at the heterozygous state, the phenomenon of expressing blend phenotypes from both alleles is called incomplete dominance. Degree of expression of each allele in the
blend phenotypes may vary based on the nature of the alleles.
In Mirabilis Jalapa (Four o’clock plant), there are several types of flower colours. When red
flowered plants are crossed with white flowered plants, all the F, hybrids (heterozygotes) have pink
flowers (Figure 6.8). This third, intermediate phenotype results from flowers of the heterozygotes
having less red pigment than the red homozygotes. 
Codominance 
In certain traits, at heterozygote state, expression of both alleles contributes equally to the °
phenotype. Such phenomenon is called co-dominance.
For example, a person with AB blood group type has both A and B carbohydrates on the surface
of red blood cells at the same time. The two carbohydrates are added to the surface of RBC by
enzymes encoded by the I* and I® alleles of a single gene. A heterozygous individual would
express both carbohydrates (I‘I®) in an equal manner.

Polyallelism (Multiple alleles)
Polyallelism refers to the presence of multiple alleles for a single genetic locus, a phenomenon
where certain traits are determined by the combination of more than two types of alleles.
E.g. there are three alleles called I A and I B and i for a single genetic locus which at different
combinations determine ABO blood groups in humans. 
In any diploid individual there are only two of the several alleles are present.
As mentioned earlier, the alleles I A and I B code for enzymes that add A and B carbohydrates to
the surface of red blood cells. The two alleles are in a co-dominant relationship. However, the
allele ‘i’ results in lack of these carbohydrates on the red cell surface and it is recessive to both
I A and I B  alleles. Therefore, both I A i and I B i genotypes will result in dominant phenotypes; i.e.
having either the A or B carbohydrates. The ii genotype will result in the recessive trait of not
having either of the carbohydrates.
Thus, based on the presence of the two carbohydrates, a person’s blood group may be one of four
types as follows: type A (carbohydrate A present), type B (carbohydrate B present), type AB (both
carbohydrates A & B present), or type O (neither of the two carbohydrates present).","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
96,Genetics,Epistasis,"Epistasis is the phenomenon resulting from interactions between genes of different loci. The
alteration in the phenotypic expression of a gene at one locus is due to the interference of another
gene at a different locus.
Epistasis could be categorized into two types; dominant epistasis and recessive epistasis, based on
the nature of the gene interaction. This causes deviation from the phenotype ratios of Mendelian
principles.

Dominant epistasis

When a dominant allele at a specific locus alters the expression of a separate gene at a different
locus, it is referred to as dominant epistasis. Dominant epistasis is seen in the plumage colour of
house fowls. Consider the following experiment.
A cross between a known homozygous, double dominant, white house fowl and a homozygous
double recessive white house fowl results a 100% white F, progeny. F, generation produced from
a cross between these F individuals consists of white and coloured fowls in the ratio of 13:3.
The colour of these two fowl varieties are determined by two separate genes;
•	The gene ‘C’/ ‘c’ is responsible for producing colour in the feathers. The dominant ‘C’
allele produces colour while the recessive ‘c’ allele result in the absence of pigmentation.
•	The gene ‘I’ is epistatic to gene ‘C’ and suppresses the expression of the colour. The
dominant ‘I’ allele prevents production of pigments while recessive ‘1’ allele is unable to
prevent coloration.
As a result, the double dominant homozygous (CCII) house fowl is white (dominant I allele
prevents coloration). The double homozygous recessive house fowl (ccil) is white (recessive c
allele couldn’t produce colour).
The F, generation all consist of heterozygous (Ccli) fowls. Due to the inhibitory effect of the
dominant ‘I’ allele, all F, individuals are white. When these fowls are allowed to interbreed, the F,
generation genotypes carrying inhibitory ‘I’ allele will give rise to white colour plumage, despite
the presence of the dominant ‘C’ allele. The presence of dominant *C’ allele in the absence of
inhibitory ‘T’ allele gives rise to coloured fowls. 
As per the Mendelian principles, genotype ratios in both F, and F, generation are expected to
be similar to the genotype ratios seen in a normal dihybrid cross. However, due to the effect of
epistasis, phenotype ratio would deviate from Mendel’s principles for normal dihybrid cross. F,
phenotypic ratio may get altered from 9:3:3:1 to 13:3.

Recessive epistasis

When a homozygous recessive genotype of a particular chromosomal locus alters/ masks the
expression of a separate gene at a different locus, it is referred to as recessive epistasis.
A good example for recessive epistasis is found for flower colour in sweet pea (Lathyrus) plant.
There are purple flowered and white flowered varieties.
Across between homozygous dominant purple flower (AABB) and homozygous recessive white
flower (aabb) strains produced 100% purple colour flowers in F, generation. Inter breeding of F,
plants produced F,, generation with purple and white flower plants in a ratio of 9: 7. 
The purple colour in sweet pea flower is governed by two dominant genes, A and B. Both A and
B alleles are coding for compounds that are necessary for the expression of purple colour. Hence,
purple colour will be there only when both the dominant alleles (A and B) are present.
Double recessive genotype at any locus (AAbb, aaBB, Aabb or aabb) results white flowers by
masking the expression of purple colour. Thus, double recessive genotype at any of the above
locus is epistatic to either homozygous dominant (AA and BB) or heterozygous condition (Aa
and Bb) of the other. (AAbb, Aabb, aaBB, aaBb, aabb- White and AaBb, AaBB, AABb, AABBPurple)(Figuer 6.13)
All of the F, generation plants were found to express purple flowers due to the presence of
heterozygous condition at both loci (AaBb).
In F, generation, plants having genotypes with both A and B alleles (9/16) express purple flowers,
and plants having genotypes with ‘aa’ and a ‘B’ allele (3/16) or ‘A’ allele and ‘bb’ alleles (3/16)
and ‘aabb’ genotype (1/16) produce white flowers, thus only two phenotypic classes are expressed;
purple and white. Thus, the normal dihybrid phenotype ratio as per Mendelian principles 9:3:3: 1
is changed to 9: 7 ratios in F, generation. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
97,Genetics,Polygenic inheritance,"Inheritance of a phenotype such as quantitative characters; height, skin colour, intelligence
quotient etc. which results from a cumulative expression of two or more genes is called polygenic
inheritance.

e.g.: Skin colour in humans is determined by many genes. For simplicity only three genes are
considered. Each gene (A, B, or C) has a dark-skin allele contributing one “unit” of darkness
to the phenotype and being incompletely dominant to the other allele (a, b, or c). Therefore
AABBCC person: very dark skin
aabbce person: very light skin
AaBbCc person: intermediate between skin colour
Because the dominant alleles from various loci have a cumulative effect, on the skin colour. (
Campbell et al, 2015)
Based on the number of genes involved in determining a polygenic character, the phenotypic and
genotypic combinations in the progenies may vary. Data for a polygenic character representing
a population may result in a normal distribution curve. The majority of offspring would be
expected to have intermediate phenotypes (skin colour in the middle range).

Genetic linkage

Some genes coding for particular characters are located on the same chromosome and also at a
closer distance. Thus, they escape from crossing over and independent assortments occur during
the meiotic cell division at gametogenesis and inherit together. This results in deviation from
Mendel’s law of independent assortment. The above phenomenon is called genetic linkage.
E.g. Inheritance of body colour and wing size in the fruit fly Drosophila
In Drosophila, wild-type flies are found to have gray bodies and normal-sized wings. Due to
mutation for the above traits body colour becomes black and wings become vestigial. Both

characters are determined by genes of autosomal chromosomes.
In this example, the mutant alleles are recessive to the wild-type alleles. The alleles for body
colour are indicated as G (gray) and g (black), and those for wing size are indicated as N (normal)
and n (vestigial).
To examine the above, wild type flies were crossed with flies which are mutant to both body color
as well as wing size and followed by a dihybrid test cross ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
98,Genetics,Human sex determination,"Sex is determined by the expression of sex chromosomes. Inhumans, each individual carries 22
pairs of autosomal chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. Type of sexchromosomes
expressing male traits are named chromosome and the other as X chromosome. Comparatively
X chromosome is bigger than Y chromosome. They both code for different traits except their
homologous regions. When X and Y chromosomes pair up, they remain homologous only in
specific regions. On the other hand when chromosome, X pair up, they both remain homologous
to each other.
On the occurrence of gametogenesis in females, meiosis yields haploid eggs carrying 100% X
chromosomes, whereas in males, half the number of the haploid sperms produced carry X and
the remaining half Y chromosomes. During the fertilization of male and female gametes, the
occasion where both egg and sperm carry X chromosomes results in a female zygote, and on the
other hand, an occasions where an egg fuses with a sperm carrying Y chromosome results in
a male zygote.
Thus, any mating occasions between male and female organisms of same species leading to
fertilization can have fifty percent chance for yielding either male or female zygotes.
Anatomical sex signs develop in humans based on the expression of XX and XY chromosomal
combination.
Human sex linked characteristics

Certain characters of humans are carried on the genes located on the sex chromosomes. Those
genes located on the sex chromosomes are called sex linked genes and the characters expressed by
them are called sex linked characters.. Characters expressed by or carried on the X chromosome
are called X- linked characters and the genes expressing or carrying those characters are called
X- linked genes. On the other hand, characters which are expressed by or carried on the Y
chromosome are called Y linked genes and the genes expressing or carrying those characters are
called Y linked genes. Y chromosome carry only few genes other than those related to the sex.
Some disorders carried on the Y-linked genes are transferred and expressed only through male
progeny. 

Inheritance of X-linked genes

The inheritance of sex linked characters or genes differ for male and female due to the XX
genotype of female and the XY genotype of male. During the fertilization, X chromosome from
both of their biological parents result a female zygote and on the other hand, X chromosome
from the female parent and Y chromosome from the male parent results a male zygote. Thus, for
females, X-linked recessive disorders are expressed only at their homozygous genotype. However
in males, due to the presence of only one X chromosome, have only one recessive X-linked allele.
Therefore, having a recessive X-linked allele with disorder is sufficient for expression.

Pleiotropy

In some occasions, expression of a single gene affects the expression of multiple traits which are
not related to each other. The above phenomenon is called as Pleiotropy. Pleiotropic alleles are
responsible for the multiple symptoms associated with certain hereditary diseases in humans,
such as cystic fibrosis and sickle-cell disease.

Sickle-cell disease
Sickle cell disease is caused by an alteration in the hemoglobin protein of red blood cells. A
single gene mutation is responsible for the above condition. In homozygous recessive individuals,
all the hemoglobins are of the sickle-cell variety. People living in high altitudes or under physical
stress experience low oxygen content in their blood. Low oxygen content in the blood may induce
the sickle-cell hemoglobin proteins to get accumulated and results sickle shape in red blood
cells. Sickle cells may clump and clog small blood vessels causing tissue and organ damage in
several body parts. This may result renal failure, heart failure and thrombosis.

Cystic fibrosis

Cystic fibrosis is a disease condition causing thicker and stickier mucus than its normal nature. As
a result, mucus get accumulated in the pancreas, lungs, digestive tract, and reproductive organs
which cause lung infections, respiratory failure, poor digestion, and infertility.
The thickening of mucus is due to the excess chlorine secretion of defected chloride channels of
the plasma membrane. The defect in the trans-membrane chloride channel occurs as a result of
the Cystic Fibrosis Trans-membrane Regulator (CFTR) protein. The altered CFTR protein is due
to the mutation of CFTR gene. This is identified as autosomal recessive disorder. 
Epigenetics
Study of occurrence of certain phenotypes of certain characters controlled by factors other than
their DNA sequence or genetic code is called epigenetics. This is due to ‘switching on’ and
‘switching off of certain genes by modifying nucleotides of a DNA sequence by methylation and
demethylation, where methyl! groups are added to wild type DNA sequence or else removed from
a methylated DNA sequence. The above random occasions result different modified expression
for a single DNA sequence.
Epigenetics results due to either inherited signals from parents or signals arising due to the
environmental factors. Inheriting epigenetic traits from parents to the children's generation is called
epigenetic inheritance. This may get reversed by various external stimuli from the environment.
Some epigenetic influences result in inappropriate gene expressions leading to cancers.
Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that occurs due to the genetic defects. In some identical twins,
only one of them gets schizophrenia and the other does not get it. This is due to two types of
expressions for same DNA sequence, called epigenetics.","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
99,Genetics,Population genetics,"Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium is used to assess whether a population is evolving with respect to
a particular characteristic/ genetic locus. The genetic makeup of a trait in a population would
remain unchanged, if they are not evolving at that genetic locus. Therefore, the predicted data
for a particular trait of a population can be compared with the actual data obtained from the same
population. The comparison of both data as mentioned above may help to determine whether the
population evolves or not for the considered trait.

Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium Principle

In 1908 British mathematician G.H. Hardy and German physician W. Weinberg, independently
showed that, in a population that is not evolving, allele and genotype frequencies will remain
constant from generation to generation. This is now considered as key concept in population
genetics and referred to as Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium Principle.
To determine whether the allele and genotype frequencies have changed in consecutive generations,
a Punnett square can be drawn, considering the combination of alleles in all possible crosses in a
population.

The following example can be used to work out the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium.
A wild flower plant population showing incomplete dominance for the flower colour alleles have
distinct phenotypes indicating their genotypes. 1.e.
Plants homozygous for the C R allele (C R C R) produce red pigment and have red flowers. Plants
homozygous for the C W allele (C W C W) have white flowers .
Heterozygous plants (C R C W) produce some red pigment and have pink flowers.
In the population of 500 flowers, there were 800 C® alleles and 200 CW alleles. Since the flower
colour of the above plant type is determined by pair of alleles, 500 flowers may consist of 1000
alleles for their flower petal’s pigmentation.
Therefore,
•	allele frequency of C R alleles (p) = 800/1000 = 0.8
•	allele frequency of C W alleles (q) = 200/1000 = 0.2

If the gametes are formed at random, the probability that an egg or sperm contains a C R or C W
allele is equal to the frequency of each of these alleles in the population. Thus, each egg has an
80% chance of containing a C R allele and a 20% chance of containing a C W allele; the same is true.
During random fertilization, gametes fuse together randomly. Therefore, rule of multiplication
can be applied to calculate the probability for each genotype combination.
According to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, if a character is determined by two alleles, the three
genotypes will appear in the following proportions;
p2 = frequency of dominant homozygotes
q2 = frequency of the recessive homozygotes
2pq = frequency of the heterozygotes
The probability that two CR alleles will come together, p x p = p2 = 0.8 x 0.8 = 0.64
Hence the proportion of CR CR genotype in the progeny = 64%
The probability that two CW alleles will come together, q x q = q2 = 0.2 x 0.2 = 0.04
Hence the proportion of CW CW genotype in the progeny = 4%,
C®C™ heterozygotes can arise in two different ways.
If the sperm provides the CR allele and the egg provides the CW allele,
the resulting CR CW heterozygotes in the progeny, p x q = 0.8 x 0.2 = 0.16 = 16%
If the egg provides the CW allele and the sperm the CR allele,
the resulting CR CW heterozygotes in the progeny, q x p= 0.2 x 0.8 = 0.16 = 16%
Thus, the total frequency of heterozygote in the progeny
pq + gp = 2pq = 0.16 + 0.16 = 0.32, or 32%
In the above example, only three kinds of genotypes are possible. When conditions suits for
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the sum of frequencies of all three genotypes equals 1. Thus, the
equation for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium can be written as below;
p2+ 2pq + q2=1

Conditions for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

The Hardy-Weinberg approach describes a hypothetical population that is not evolving and
fulfilling the following conditions.

1. Absence of mutations. Mutations result changes in alleles. Insertion, deletion, or
substitution of nucleotides result altered alleles. This leads to a modified gene pool.
2. Occurrence of random mating. Breeding occurs randomly without any influence that
causes selectiveness. Mating of closely related individuals may alter the allele frequencies.
3. Absence of natural selection. All genotypes of the progeny are expected to survive
irrespective of their differences, abilities and the environmental conditions. Variations in
survival and reproduction of some genotypes may alter the frequency of alleles.
4. Size of the population is extremely large. In small populations, particular genotypes may
disappear due to death or infertility. Therefore, larger the population, more likely to favor
the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
5. Absence of immigration or emigration. Individuals moving in and out of the populations
may cause appearance of new genes and disappearance of existing genes. This is called
gene flow and it may alter allele frequencies.
Naturally, most populations do deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium except for certain
genetic loci. Slowly evolving populations may also do not deviate much from Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium and therefore, they remain as predicted for a non-evolving population. 

Evolution and change in gene frequency

Evolution can be explained in terms of changes in allele (gene) frequencies over generations.
A species evolves when changes in gene frequencies drive the species into a higher level of
adaptation for a specific ecological niche.
Genetic variation within the population is the key to evolution. Mutation will create new alleles
and migration will include it into the population to increase variation. Natural selection will
then choose the better adapted individuals based on their phenotypic variations, causing
population to evolve. As a result, after the evolution the population is at a higher adaptive level
compared to the level of adaptation they showed before being evolved.
This concept can be illustrated with the evolution of the peppered moth in England during the time
of industrialization. The moth had two phenotypic varieties based on their colour; dark and light.
Prior to the industrialization of central England, the light-coloured allele was most prevalent. The
light-colored moths had an advantage over the dark coloured ones as they could hide on the
white-barked trees to avoid predation from birds.
Due to the pollutants generated parallel to the industrialization, the light-coloured trees were
stained dark. This exposed the light- coloured moths to predation, reducing their numbers. As a
result, the light- colour allele became less prevalent. In its place, the dark-colour allele became
more predominant, because dark moths could camouflage themselves better on the stained trees
and avoid being eaten by their bird predators. The population evolved to a higher adaptive state
with the change in gene frequencies (light — colour allele frequency went down while dark —
colour allele frequency went up). ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
100,Genetics,Plant and animal breeding,"People have intervened in the reproduction and genetic make up of plants and animals since the
dawn of agriculture, eight to ten thousand years ago. Early farmers selected the best looking
plants and seeds and saved them to plant for the next season. Likewise, the best farm animals were
allowed to mate with each other to preserve and improve their desirable traits. 
This phenomenon wherein human beings interfere in the process of reproduction to allow only
selective mating to occur, so that offspring with improved characters are produced is called
breeding (as against natural reproduction).

With the science of genetics became better understood, plant and animal breeders used what
they knew about the genes of a plant or an animal to select for specific desirable traits to develop
improved plant varieties or animal breeds. The selection for features such as faster growth, higher
yields, pest and disease resistance, larger seeds or sweeter fruits in crop plants, colour and pattern
of the skin, hair or feathers in animals have now dramatically changed domesticated species
compared to their wild relatives.

Importance of plant and animal breeding

In breeding programs, the attributes, structure and composition of plant and animals are
manipulated in such a way to make them more useful to humans. Accordingly, plant and animal
breeding has a significant impact of world’s agro-economy as discussed below;

1. Addressing world food and feed quality needs
An estimated 800 million people in the world, including 200 million children, suffer from
malnutrition and associated health issues. Plant and animal breeding helps to enhance the value
of food by improving their nutritional quality. For example, rice, which is the most widely eaten
staple food, lacks many essential vitamins.
Another problem encountered in major food crops is the presence of toxic substances within them
such as alkaloids in yam, cyanogenic glucosides in cassava (mantioc), trypsin inhibitors in pulses,
and steroidal alkaloids in potatoes. Plant breeding is useful in reducing these toxic components
and making them safer to eat. Plant breeding is also useful in making some plant products more
digestible. For example, a high lignin content of the plant material reduces its value for animal
feed which can be overcome with the use of breeding techniques.

2. Addressing food supply needs for a growing world population
It is anticipated that an additional three billion people will be added to the world population
within the next three decades. Aligned with this population growth, an expansion in world food
supply should be required to meet the projected needs. Unfortunately, land for farming is scarce
and therefore more food will have to be produced on less land. This calls for improved and high
yielding animal and plant varieties to be developed. In response plant breeding has produced
super rice which has 50% more yield compared to the normal rice, super wheat which boost the harvest by 20-40% of normal wheat and several high yielding corn, maize and soya bean varieties.
The total production of meat and milk has also increased considerably over the years due to
careful use of selective breeding techniques.
3. Need to adapt to environmental stresses
Weather and soil conditions can have a major impact crop yield. Climate changes and global
warming are partly responsible for modifying the crop production environment (e.g., some
regions of the world are getting drier and others saltier). To meet the increasing demand for food
new cultivars need to be bred which can sustain these adverse conditions. For example, it is
necessary to develop new plant types that can resist various biotic (diseases and insect pests) and
other abiotic (e.g., salt, drought, heat, cold) stresses in the production environment. In response,
genetically modified, pest resistant cotton, maize, and potatoes which carry Bt toxin, salinity
tolerant rice varieties, cold tolerant tobacco, potato and strawberry varieties etc. are now available
in agricultural industry. Likewise, both crop plants and farm animals (cattle, pig sheep goat
etc.) with increased immunity to pathogens have also been produced through various breeding
techniques.
4. Satisfying industrial and other end-use requirements
Consumers are having different requirements based on the texture, colour and composition of a
particular food item irrespective of its taste or nutritional value. These diverse demands for the
same food can be now successfully met through breeding procedures. For example, potato is a
versatile crop used for food and industrial products. Different varieties are being developed by
breeders for baking, cooking, fries (frozen), chipping, and for starch. These cultivars differ in size,
specific gravity, and sugar content, among other properties. High sugar content is undesirable
for frying or chipping because the sugar caramelizes under high heat to produce undesirable
browning of fries and chips. Likewise, there is a high demand for seedless fruits such as grapes,
melon and strawberries and also for leaner meat. Depending on these end-user requirements, it is
possible to develop quality added products using animal and plant breeding techniques.

5. Developing animal and plant varieties with aesthetic values
Aesthetics is of major importance in horticulture as well as in the industry of ornamental and
pet animals. The ornamental plant industry depends to a large extent on the development of new
varieties that exhibit new flower/ leaf colours, varying sizes and attractive shapes etc. using plant
breeding.
The pursuit of novelty has spurred a similar explosion of types in pet animals as well. Today
selective breeding for numerous morphological features and functional abilities have given rise to
nearly 400 dog breeds making them one of the most diversified species on earth. Likewise, there are close to 50 rabbit breeds, vast number of bird varieties and an extensive range of ornamental
fish.","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
101,Genetics,Breeding techniques,"Plant and animal breeders use numerous techniques to create new varieties with enhanced
features. Many of these techniques have been successfully practiced over centuries even without
the knowledge of the underlying genetics. Following section summarizes some of these traditional
breeding techniques which has caused significant improvements in agriculture and farming.

I. Artificial selection
Artificial selection is the earliest form of biotechnology and has been used by humans for thousands
of years. It, is a process of selective breeding, where plants or animals with specific traits were
selected to breed so that their desired traits could be passed to the next generations to produce
a high performing new variety. The method has made a huge impact on agriculture by way of
improving plant and animal products before the discovery of more sophisticated technologies like
genetic engineering.
The first prerequisite of artificial selection is the availability of variation with respect to
the desirable characters. Once a population with a desirable variation is recognized, the best
performing individuals for the desired feature are selected. For example, when selecting for fruit
size in plants, only those giving the biggest fruits are chosen for the breeding program and
the rest of the population is discarded or rejected. The progeny of the selected individuals is
grown further and again screened for the desired feature. This process is repeated sometimes
for many generations, until a uniform plant population is attained which has the best-desired
characters. Eventually, a new uniform crop variety with the desired characteristic is produced by
this successive selection, followed by multiplication of the selected individuals.
The advantage of selective breeding is that it uses the processes of natural selection, but under
direct supervision from carefully selected animals or plants with the desired traits. There are no
genetic modifications or other forms of tampering that could potentially harm people and the risk
to the plant or animal is often minimum.
Crops like corn and wheat are commonly selectively bred in order to obtain the highest yielding
plants. Breeding animals with higher protein and lower fat percentages, as well as plants that have
higher nutritional values, had been used to create food sources with a higher quality of nutrition.
In addition, selective breeding has, effectively removed undesirable traits such as low resistance
to disease, in some animals and plants. However, selective breeding among animals can take a long time for the process to work. In horse
breeding, for example, the given standard to establish a new breed is to have offspring with the
desired traits to be produced over the course of 7 generations. This means it may take 25-50 years
for the desired traits to become a foundational component of an animal.

2. Inbreeding and out breeding
I. Inbreeding
The breeding among genetically similar individuals are known as inbreeding.
Among plant breeders the term “inbreeding” is commonly used to mean self-fertilization, Le.
the fertilization of a flower with its own pollen or with pollen from a different flower on the
same plant. This is done to produce an inbred variety, which is exactly the same generation after
generation. Many important crops, such as wheat, oats, barley, and tobacco, are produced from
seeds which are habitually self-fertilized.
However, in animal breeding the term "" inbreeding "" is used to refer to the mating of closely related
individuals, as, for instance, the mating of father and daughter, brother and sister, or cousins.
In both crop plants and farm animals, inbreeding brings uniformity of the required type while
preserving the desired characters. Inbreeding is used for developing pure lines in agriculture as
well as for research.
As a rule, inbreeding increases homozygosis and thus exposes harmful recessive genes which
would have otherwise stay hidden among heterozygotes. Continued inbreeding, therefore, reduces
genetic fitness of the population. As a result, the growth and fertility of the inbred population
would go down with adverse effect on their productivity. Prevalence of genetic disorders might
also increase among the inbred population. This phenomenon of having a reduced genetic fitness
in a given population as a result of inbreeding is called inbreeding depression.
However, in agriculture and animal husbandry, positive effects of inbreeding will be harnessed as
much as possible. To ensure this, only those offspring that are exhibiting the desired trait, without
other negative ones, will be used for future breeding. The negatively affected individuals in the
progeny are removed or are not be allowed to be bred. Thus, inbreeding is used in agriculture to
help accumulation of superior genes. 

II. Outbreeding
When plants or animals of different breeds (races) are mated with each other, it is known as
outbreeding or cross breeding. This allows the desirable characters of the exotic parent, which
the indigenous parent does not have, to be transmitted to the progeny.
For example, cross breeding is carried out by animal breeders to enhance milk and meat production.
In India zebu breeds of cows and nondescript cows are crossed with exotic breeds like Holstein
Fresian, Brown Swiss and Jersey bulls or their semen, to enhance the milk production potential of
the progeny. Likewise crop plants like corn and hemp, are normally cross-fertilized.

3. Hybrid breeding

When genetically unrelated pure-bred plants or animals in the same species are mated with each
other it is known as hybridization or outcrossing.
Generally, this is carried out with plants and animals who do not share common ancestors on
either side of their pedigree up to four to six generations. The offspring of such a mating is known
as the out cross and will possess stable characteristics and hybrid vigour. Hybrid vigour, also
called heterosis, is the increase in such characteristics as size, growth rate, fertility, and yield in
the hybrid organism over those of its parents.
Plant and animal breeders exploit heterosis by mating two different pure-bred lines that have
certain desirable traits. The first-generation offspring generally show, in greater measure, the
desired characteristics of both parents. This vigour may decrease, however, if the hybrids are
mated together; so the parental lines must be maintained and crossed for each new crop or group
desired.
In plant breeding, because creating hybrids involves many years of preparation to create pure
lines that have to be constantly maintained so that F, hybrid seeds can be harvested each year, the

seeds then become more expensive. Nevertheless, hybrid seeds have had a tremendous impact
on agricultural productivity. Today, nearly all corn and 50% of all rice are hybrids. In the US, the
widespread use of corn hybrids, coupled with improved cultural practices by farmers, has more
than tripled corn grain yields over the past 50 years from an average of 35 bushels per acre in
the 1930s to 115 bushels per acre in the 1990s. No other major crop anywhere in the world even
comes close to equaling that sort of success story.
Many cultivars of popular vegetables or ornamental plants are hybrids. In terms of improved plant
characteristics, tropical vegetable breeders can point to some rather clear achievements over the
last two decades: 
•	Yield improvement. Hybrids often out yield traditional true breeding varieties (inbred
varieties) by 50-100% due to its improved vigor, improved genetic disease resistance,
improved fruit setting under stress, and higher female/male flower ratios.
•	Extended growing season. Hybrids often mature up to 15 days earlier than local true
breeding varieties. For many crops, the hybrid’s relative advantage over the true breeding
is most pronounced under stress conditions.
•	Quality improvement. Hybrids have helped stabilize product quality at a higher, and more
uniform level — this implies improved consumption quality (e.g. firm flesh of wax gourd,
crispy taste of watermelon).

4. Interspecific breeding
In this approach, which is also known as interspecific hybridization, male and female organisms
of two different species are mated. The progeny obtained from such a mating are usually different
from both the parental species and may be fertile, partially fertile, or sterile.
Plants hybridize much more frequently and successfully than animals do. Pollen from flowering
plants disperses widely and may land on flowers of other species allowing natural interspecific
breeding to take place. Plant forms are less stringently controlled than animal forms, and so the
intermediate form of a plant hybrid is more likely to be physiologically successful.
Often interspecific hybrids are sterile or for some other reason cannot interbreed with the parental
species. Occasionally sterile interspecific hybrids can undergo a doubling of their chromosome
set and become fertile tetraploids (four sets of chromosomes). For example, the bread wheats
that humans use today are a result of two hybridizations each followed by chromosome
doubling to produce fertile hexaploids (six sets of chromosomes). In such instances, the hybrids
can become new species with characteristics different from either of the parents. Crop yields
increase dramatically when hybridization is used to exceed one or more of the parents in size and
reproductive potential. For example, boysenberries (Rubus ursinus x idaeus) were developed at
Knott's Berry Farm in California. They are a result of a set of crosses between blackberries (Rubus
fruticosus), European raspberries (Rubus idaeus) and loganberries (Rubus * loganobaccus).
For many fruit crop species, the use of interspecific breeding is increasing, in order to utilize
naturally occurring sources of pest and disease resistance, fruit-quality components, etc. within
the available germ plasm. For example, winter hardiness of apple was improved by making a
hybrid species Malus x domestica from Malus * asiatica and Malus pumifolia.
However, among animals interspecific breeding is restricted to few species. Common examples
include Mule (male donkey x female horse), Hinny (male horse x female donkey) and Liger (male
lion x female tiger).  Note that in mules and hinnies, the common genus the parents belong to is Equus and liger, its Panthera. Other examples are zebra/donkey cross resulting in an offspring called zonkey, zebra/
horse cross resulting in zorse. The offspring from this cross could develop into adults, but may not
develop functional gametes. Sterility is often attributed to the different number of chromosomes
the two species have, for example, donkeys have 62 chromosomes, horses have 64 chromosomes. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
102,Genetics,Genetic principles of breeding techniques,"From the beginning of plant and animal breeding, farmers made use of principles of genetics,
with or without awareness of these concepts. Following section explains, three most widely used
genetic principles applied in animal and plant breeding at present.
1. Polyploidy

Polyploidy refers to the presence of more than two complete sets of homologous chromosomes
per cell nucleus. This is a widely used principle in plant breeding. In plants, polyploidy can be
induced artificially using antimitotic agent, colchicine.
One of the most important consequences of polyploidy for plant breeding are the increment in
plant organs (‘‘gigas” effect) caused by the larger number of gene copies. Polyploid individuals
may thus exhibit larger organs compared to their diploid counterparts, such as roots, leaves, tubers,
fruits, flowers and seeds. Polyploid plants also have lower growth rates, and tend to flower later
or over a longer period of time than related diploids, which is a desirable feature for ornamental
breeding.
In addition, polyploidy often results in reduced fertility due to meiotic errors, allowing the
production of seedless varieties such as the triploid watermelon. On the other hand, when the
crossing between two species is not possible because of differences in ploidy level, polyploids
can be used as a bridge for gene transferring between them. Similarly, the genome doubling in a
newly formed sterile hybrid allows the restoration of its fertility.
Genome redundancy (having additional gene copies due to increase ploidy) have other benefits
as well. It promotes a “buffering” effect in which the deleterious alleles are masked by the extra
copies of wild-type alleles. At the same time, it allows functional diversification of redundant gene
copies, in which one member of a duplicated gene pair mutates and acquires a novel function,
without compromising essential functions. 
The increment in heterozygosity is another feature that accompanies polyploidy. Higher levels
of heterozygosity have been positively related to vigor increment in maize, potato and alfalfa
improving the product quality and increasing the tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stresses.

2. Mutation Breeding
Methods for inducing mutation have the potential of producing new sources of genetic variability
for crop breeding. These methods can be employed when it appears there is little, or no, variability
for the character to be improved available within the gene pool of the species. This method of
inducing desirable mutations in crop plants using either chemical or physical agents was termed
mutation breeding.
Several agents can be used to cause mutations. This include ionizing radiation such as gamma
rays, protons, neutrons, alpha and beta particles and chemicals such as sodium azide and ethyl
methane sulphonate. Since the desirable mutations induced by these treatments are found at a
very low frequency (0.1% of total mutations), breeders have to screen a large population to select
a desirable mutation. In addition, most mutations act in a recessive fashion and are likely to be
masked by their dominant allelic counterparts making the screening procedure even harder.
The effectiveness of using induced mutation depends on the breeding system of the plant. Its use
in self-pollinated plants is likely to be more successful than in crosspollinated ones. Populations of
cross-pollinated plants usually possess stores of genetic variability in the recessive condition and
it would not be likely that induced mutation would produce significant amounts of new variability.
Further, induced mutation is potentially useful in the improvement of asexually propagated crop
plants.
Despite these limitations, mutation breeding efforts continue around the world today. It has
improved both morphological and physiological characteristic of both crop and ornamental plants
such as flower colours, seed size, crop yield, disease resistance and salinity tolerance, drought
tolerance and early maturity. Examples of plants that have been produced via mutation breeding
include wheat, barley, rice, potatoes, soybeans, and onions.

3. Genetic modification
Genetic modification, also called genetic engineering, is the direct manipulation of an organism's
genes to change the genetic makeup of cells. In this method, genetic material is obtained from
one organism showing a desired trait and will be inserted to another second organism using
recombinant DNA technology, so that the receiving organism will also show the same desirable
trait. Thus, by transferring genes within and across species, improved or novel organisms are
produced.
In traditional plant breeding techniques transfer of genes is limited to the closely related species
or genera. For example, traditional breeding techniques could not be used to insert a desired
gene from daffodil into rice because the many intermediate species between rice and daffodil
and their common ancestor is extinct. With genetic engineering, however, such gene transfers
can be done more quickly, more specifically, and without the need for intermediate species.
The term transgenic organism or genetically modified organism (GMO) is used to describe
organisms that have been engineered to express a gene from another species. Advocates for
plant biotechnology believe that the genetic engineering of crop plants is the key to overcoming
some of the most pressing problems of the 21st century, including world hunger and fossil fuel
dependency. Examples of transgenic plant varieties include transgenic papaya that is resistant to
ring spot virus, “golden rice,” with increased levels of beta-carotene and salinity resistant rice
varieties among others.

Natural or artificial breeding: Advantages and disadvantages

Although artificial breeding is extensively practiced today with remarkable economic gains, there
are serval drawbacks in the method in comparison to the natural breeding.
The artificial breeding is geared towards producing a uniform set of plants or animals with traits
desirable to humans. The development of this uniformity needs compromising the variability
within the species. This reduction of genetic diversity will have adverse consequences on the
evolutionary fitness of the species leading to low resistance to infections, higher prevalence of
congenital anomalies and reduced fertility. For example, when a population of animals or plants
with the same genetic traits are attacked by a pathogen to which they are susceptible, the entire
population is likely suffer due to the absence of the resistant trait within the gene pool. This
limited opportunities for the natural selection to act upon the population is likely to drive them
towards a lower fitness plateau.
On the other hand, natural breeding can rule out weaknesses and disabilities which affect survival
by allowing natural selection to act upon the species. This will produce fitter and stronger
individuals in the long run. However, the natural selection would not guarantee a productivity
increase in the consumer perspective, despite the increase in genetic fitness.
As discussed earlier, sometimes inbreeding is practiced as an artificial breeding technique. This
would result in an increase in homozygosis which would in turn increase the expression of
recessive deleterious mutations that would otherwise stay masked within heterozygotes. This can
cause the population to undergo inbreeding depression with adverse effects on the overall fitness.
Sometimes artificial breeding can exhibit negative correlated responses. This refers to the fact
that while artificial breeding is improving certain characters in the population, simultaneously
and unintendedly it could lead towards deterioration of other characters that are not under direct observation. For example, the shape of the skull in some dog breeds has made it difficult for them
to eat normal food because of the upper jaw being much shorter than the lower jaw, such as in the
case of Boxer or the Bulldog. Likewise, selection for large offspring has resulted in a high fraction
of difficult births, sometimes requiring caesarean sections in the Texel sheep, and even almost as a
standard way of delivering in the beef cattle breeds Belgian White-and-Blue cattle and the Dutch
Improved Red-and-White. This kind of negative responses are difficult to predict in advance and
usually only visible after the new breed is established.
Although there are negative impacts artificial breeding is still preferred over natural breeding for
the numerous advantages it could bestow upon overall animal and plant productivity as discussed
earlier.","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 5 & 6 ), Resource Book"
103,Molecular Biology and Recombinant DNA Technology,Molecular Biology and Recombinant DNA Technology,"Nucleic acids are capable in directing their own replication from their monomers. In most
organisms, DNA is found as the genetic material. However , some viruses such as influenza virus,
consist RNA as their genetic material. Accurate replication of DNA, its transmission from one
generation to the other and its ability to store and express hereditary information facilitates DNA
for acting as vital genetic material in organisms.
DNA Double Helix Model: James Watson and Francis Crick, based on the X-ray crystallography
of a DNA molecule obtained by Rosalind Franklin, proposed the double helix model to describe
how the six molecules; de-oxy ribose sugar, phosphate group and four different nitrogenous
bases, are organized into DNA and explain its properties. According to this model, DNA is a
twisted ladder (spiral staircase) in which the rails are composed of alternating phosphate and
sugar molecules forming the back bone. The steps of the ladder are paired nitrogenous bases. A
purine is paired with a pyrimidine as per the base pairing rule with either two hydrogen bonds
(A=T) or three (G = C). T.H. Morgan and his group, through their experiments concluded that
chromosomes are made up of DNA and proteins and genes as regions of chromosomes.

Architecture of Chromosomes

Architecture of chromosomes is the way the DNA molecules are arranged in the nucleoid or
nuclear region of the cytoplasm of the prokaryotic cells or in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. NA of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes are called chromosomes. However, true chromosomes
are present only in eukaryotes.
Prokaryotic (bacterial) chromosome is a single double stranded circular DNA molecule associated
with a few protein molecules. Eukaryotes have several chromosomes, each consisting of a single
double stranded linear DNA associated with histones and other protein molecules.
When the size of all chromosomes of an organism are considered, it is an enormous amount
of DNA. These facts illustrate that, a cell has a huge problem in having its DNA either in the
nucleoid of prokaryotes or the nucleus of eukaryotes. The containment of the genome/DNA in the
nucleoid or in the nucleus is called DNA packaging.

Architecture of Prokaryotic chromosomes

Packaging of DNA in prokaryotes is facilitated by the proteins associated with the DNA molecule.
The protein molecules cause the DNA to coil (or fold or loop) and supercoil, so the DNA molecule
is compacted into the nucleoid. The DNA molecule is initially coiled into loops and these loops
then independently supercoil into domains identifiable in electron micrographs. The loops of
compacted mass of DNA are bound to a ‘core’ consisting of RNA and protein. The ‘core’ also
attaches the chromosome to the membrane. The supercoiled DNA can be relaxed by introducing
single strand nicks. Since the chromosomes are attached to the membrane and held together by
the ‘core’ acting as a barrier for rotation, the domains can relax and supercoil independently.
This is important in the transcription of specific genes. Removal of RNA will lead to loss of
independence of the loops. In addition to the chromosomal DNA, certain prokaryotes have extra chromosomal genetic
elements called plasmids. They are also circular DNA and are coiled and supercoiled. 

Architecture of Eukaryotic chromosomes

Eukaryotic chromosomes are associated with a large number of proteins called histones that helps
to organize the DNA inside the nucleus. This DNA-protein complex is known as chromatin. The
chromatin may be lightly packed as in euchromatin or tightly packed as in heterochromatin.
Euchromatin is rich in genes and is probably active in transcription. Heterochromatin consists
nucleotide sequences which are mostly inactive. They may contribute in gene regulation,
epigenetic inheritance and protection of chromosomal integrity.
In the first level, the double helix winds around a complex of eight histone molecules. These are
called nucleosomes and they look like beads of a necklace. The adjoining beads of nucleosomes
are linked together by a stretch of DNA: linker DNA. In the second level, the nucleosomes twist and pack in a spiral fashion to form a chromatin fiber
of roughly 30 nm in diameter:30 nm fibers from 10 nm fibers. At the third level, the 30 nm fiber forms loops, called looped domains, attached to a protein
scaffold. This structure has a thickness of 300 nm. (Figure 7.5)
Finally, at the fourth level, the looped domains coil, fold and further compact to form the mitotic
chromosome. The diameter of a chromatid is about 700 nm. In the metaphase chromosome, the
chromatids are already replicated ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
104,Molecular Biology and Recombinant DNA Technology,DNA Replication ,"This is the process which copies a double stranded DNA molecule to produce two identical
copies. Because, DNA replication process is basically similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
However, there are differences in enzymes involved. This is because the Eukaryotic nuclear
DNA is organized into chromosomes and contain histones in their structure for packaging, and the
prokaryotic DNA are usually found as circular molecules, which are supercoiled for packaging.
Importance of DNA replication
e The essential information for life is stored in DNA. Therefore, the new cells produced
must receive the DNA from their parent cells as, each cell in the body of a diploid organism
should contain the same genetic information as was in the zygote. A multicellular organism
grows by addition of new cells.
e Damaged or dead cells are also replaced by new cells.
e In asexual reproduction, the offspring is identical to the parent cell. This is possible only
because DNA has the ability to replicate and provide an identical set of genetic information
stored in DNA to each daughter cell by mitosis.
e In sexually reproducing organisms, meiosis occurs at some point of life cycle in order to
maintain a constant number of chromosomes. DNA replication occurs prior to meiosis.
e DNA replication is a very accurate process, so that it makes identical copies. However, rare
errors occur in DNA replication, introducing mutations which results in variation. Variation
leads to evolution of organisms.
e Therefore, DNA replication is important in maintenance of the life of an individual organism
and continuation of a species.
The process of DNA Replication in prokaryotes
The entire replication process is carefully controlled and coordinated by a number of enzymes
and other proteins.
DNA is synthesized on the existing DNA strands of the double helix of the DNA molecule. The
parent DNA strands are used as the templates. Thus, the newly synthesized DNA double helix
contains one parent DNA strand and a new complimentary strand.
First of all, the tightly packed DNA (supercoiled DNA in prokaryotes and chromatin in eukaryotes)
has to relax, so that the DNA replication machinery can have access to the place where the
replication begins.
The separation of the double helix occurs at the origin of replication. Origin of replication or
‘Ori’ is a specific sequence of DNA to which proteins that initiate DNA replication bind. Starting
from this, the entire circular DNA is replicated on both directions. Since the enzyme synthesizing
the new DNA strand can move only in one direction (5' to 3' direction) one of the new strands
can be synthesized continuously while the other will be synthesized as small fragments. The small fragments of lagging strand are called Okazaki fragments. These are called leading and
lagging strands respectively. Replication of large DNA molecules may begin at several origins of
replication to speed up the process. 

Functions of major enzymes and other proteins of replication machinery.

A number of enzymes and other proteins are required in the replication of DNA. These proteins
assemble at the origin of replication. The major enzymes involved in the DNA replication are:
helicase, topoisomerase, primase, DNA polymerases and DNA ligase. There are several other
proteins in the replication machinery including Single Strand Binding (SSB) proteins. 
Helicase: These are the enzymes that unwind the double helix and separate the two strands of a
DNA molecule, with the expense of energy as ATP. The separation occurs by breaking hydrogen
bonds between the base pairs of the two strands. This is important for exposing the two strands to
function as template for new DNA synthesis (replication).

Topoisomerase: These enzymes are working ahead of the direction of DNA synthesis.
The untwisting of the strands at one place causes further twisting and strain on other places.
Topoisomerase enzymes, introduce breaks on one or both strands of DNA, twist the molecule to
relieve the strain and then reseal the cut ends.

Single Strand Binding Proteins (SSB): These protein molecules bind to exposed single stranded
DNA to prevent re-pairing of the separated DNA strands and to stabilize them. If the two strands
re-pair, then they cannot serve as templates for new DNA synthesis.

Primase: In order to synthesize a new DNA strand on a template, complementary
deoxyribonucleotides should be added one after the other in the correct sequence. This is done
by DNA polymerase, but DNA polymerases can add nucleotides only to the 3’ end of an already
formed nucleic acid chain. For this, a small fragment of nucleic acid chain is sufficient and this
fragment is called a primer. Primase is a type of RNA polymerase which can initiate synthesis
of RNA on a DNA template by adding ribonucleotides. Primase adds a short RNA primer on the
DNA template forming DNA-RNA hybrid to facilitate the action of DNA polymerase 

DNA polymerases: There are several types of DNA polymerases. One type of DNA polymerase
initiates DNA polymerization by adding a deoxyribonucleotide to the 3° end of a primer
and continues polymerization on 5’ to 3” direction elongating the new DNA strand with
deoxyribonucleotides with bases complementary to template 
his DNA polymerase is almost 100% error-free in adding correct complementary nucleotides
to growing strand, according to the nucleotide sequence of the parent DNA strands. However one
error in 10° added nucleotides is possible, has a proofreading mechanism and therefore can correct
its own mistakes and the error rate will be reduced by 100,000 times to one in 10!°. Therefore, the
daughter DNA molecules are almost identical to the parent DNA molecule, and of course to each
other. 
When a wrong nucleotide is added to the growing chain of DNA by DNA Polymerase this
mismatch is identified by the same enzyme, stops adding the next nucleotide, removes the
incorrect nucleotide by exonuclease activity and continues again its polymerase activity. This is
called as proofreading activity of DNA polymerase. 
Another type of DNA polymerase identifies DNA-RNA hybrid, removes ribonucleotides and
replaces those with deoxyribonucleotides and so replaces the RNA primer with DNA. Now the
replication of the DNA segment is complete, but the DNA polymerase unable to connect the ends
of Okazaki fragments, results gaps.

DNA ligase: In DNA synthesis, it joins the newly synthesized adjacent fragments making
a complete strand by the formation of a phosphodiester bond. It seals the gaps of the newly
synthesized DNA strand. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
105,Molecular Biology and Recombinant DNA Technology,Similarities and Differences between Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic DNA Replication,"Eukaryotes share many characteristics of DNA replication of the Prokaryotes. They also use
helicase to unwind the dsDNA, and use DNA polymerases for the polymerization reaction, The
replication is originated in both types at specific sequences (origin of replication — Ori) to initiate
DNA replication, packed DNA is relaxed with topoisomerase and replication process move in
the same manner and therefore having leading and lagging strand. RNA primers are formed and
replaced. The gaps are sealed by DNA ligase. 
Although the process is superficially similar, there are several significant differences too. The
size of the DNA molecule in a eukaryotic chromosome is much larger than that of a circular
DNA molecule of a bacterium. Therefore prokaryotes usually have one Ori while an Eukaryotic
chromosome has several Ori. The DNA polymerases in eukaryotes and prokaryotes are different
from each other in their structure, while having the same functions. The DNA replication of the
prokaryotes occurs continuously, whereas in eukaryotes it happens only in the S-phase of cell
cycle. 
DNA repair and its significance
Damage to DNA can be caused by various chemical and physical agents introducing mismatches
in DNA double helix and may lead to a permanent change in the sequence of DNA. This may
also be caused by errors in DNA replication that goes unnoticed by proofreading. This is called
mutation. A mutation or collection of mutations can make a cell malignant and result in a cancer.
Mutations also alter the phenotype, and very often they are either lethal or at least produce
unfavorable phenotypes. When the mutations occur in cells producing gametes, they may be
passed onto the next generations resulting in variations among offspring.
When such a mismatch is there, the shape of the double helix is distorted. For example, UV
radiation can covalently link two adjacent thymine bases, distorting the DNA molecule. One of
the two copies of DNA molecules generated by these distorted sequences carries a permanent
change in the sequence, a mutation. Such distorted locations are usually recognized and repaired
by the DNA repair mechanism of the cell before it becomes permanent, and that reduces the
risk of accumulation of mutations. Because DNA repair is very important for the survival of
organisms, a large number of DNA repairing enzymes are found in various organisms.
Such enzymes may cut off the mismatched sequences in the damaged strand and replace with
correct nucleotides. The cutting (excision) is done by a nuclease and filling the gap, using the
correct strand as the template, is done by a type of DNA polymerase. This is called nucleotide
excision repair. DNA ligase completes the DNA strand by sealing it with a phosphodiester bond.
Genes and how they work

The nature of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes

When Gregor Mendel put forward his laws of inheritance in 1860, he used the term hereditary
factors to explain what control the characters shown in a phenotype and which are transmitted
from generation to generation. At that time, these were imaginary units and where they were
located in cellular structure was not known. Today, these physical and functional units of heredity have been identified as genes that are located on
chromosomes as discrete units. This disclosure began with
the development of cytology and the ability to observe the
behavior of chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis. Behavior
of chromosomes and the behavior of the Mendel’s hereditary
factors show the same pattern. In eukaryotes, chromosomes
occur in pairs in diploid somatic cells, and hence genes also
occur in pairs. A pair of chromosomes, coming from the two
parents, containing the same genes is called homologous
chromosomes. Generally prokaryotes have one chromosome
in each cell, and hence may be considered haploid. 
The location or the site of a gene on the chromosome is called a locus (loci in plural). The alteration
versions of genes that are located at the same locus on different chromosomes are called alleles
of the genes. Prokaryotic genes are housed in loci on the circular DNA molecule, as discrete
segments of DNA.
There are many steps in a biochemical pathway and each step is
controlled by a gene, and therefore many genes are involved in
controlling a particular phenotype. In eukaryotes these genes are
scattered among several chromosomes, while in prokaryotes, they
are arranged in the same region of the chromosome one after the
other as clusters. These clusters are expressed together by a single
control region and are transcribed into one MRNA. Such MRNA
molecules will be translated into several different polypeptides
with respect to the genes of the DNA template. These organized
gene clusters in prokaryotes are called operons.
Operon: A group of genes
that functions as a single
transcription unit. It is
(an operator, a promoter)
and structural genes that are
transcribed into one mRNA.
Coding for several peptides.
comprised of a control region
In prokaryotes, all DNA segments in the chromosome are functional (either transcribed into
mRNA or act as control regions), while in eukaryotes, a large proportion of DNA has no identified
function. Such DNA segments that are present in between the genes are referred to as intergenic
DNA. There are also sequences within the genes that are transcribed, but are not translated into
polypeptides. That means there are coding sequences as well as noncoding sequences in the
transcript of the gene. The noncoding sequences within the genes are called introns while the
sequences that code for polypeptides are exons. Accordingly the transcript contains exons as well
as introns. The transcript is a pre-mRNA and it undergoes processing where introns are excised
and exons are joined in order to produce mRNA. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
106,Molecular Biology and Recombinant DNA Technology,Chromosome Theory of Inheritance ,"Evidences collected in genetic studies were noted by
scientists and several of them independently developed chromosome theory of inheritance. The
Mendelian hereditary factors or genes are located on the chromosomes at specific loci. Therefore
chromosomes and genes housed on them occur in pairs in diploid cells. The aligning of homologous
chromosomes in metaphase I occurs at random and therefore this is independent assortment
(i.e. no order in arranging maternal and paternal chromosomes). In anaphase I the independently
assorted homologous chromosomes separate reducing the number of chromosomes to half. This
is segregation. With the independent assortment and segregation of chromosomes, alleles of
genes on nonhomologous chromosomes are assorted independently in different combinations in
Metaphase I. The alleles segregate after completion of anaphase 1 to form four haploid cells
having different allele combinations in equal proportions. The same reasoning can explain the
phenotypic ratios observed by Mendel in F, generation after random crossing of F,

Gene Expression

Genes control characters when a gene is at work and, it is said that the gene is expressed.
Gene expression is the process by which the information stored in a gene is used to make a
functional gene product. The final product of a gene is usually a polypeptide, which after suitable
modifications becomes a protein. However several RNAs also function as final gene products.
For example, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) are such RNA molecules, having
direct functions .
In examining how genes control characters, it was
revealed that (the first suggestion came in 1902
from Archibald Garrod) inherited diseases are
caused by the inability to produce related enzymes
as a result of inborn errors in metabolism. The
symptoms of a hereditary disease condition,
known as alkaptonuria is due to inability to make
the metabolic enzyme which metabolizes the
chemical alkapton. In patients alkapton remains in
urea and its oxidation results in black coloration
of urine. 
The gene expression begins by copying the
The term copying is used in transcription,
as in linguistics, since the information
written in the nucleotide sequence of DNA
by four letters (AGCT) is copied to the
same chemical language as a nucleotide
sequence of RNA written in four letters
(AGCU), with only difference that T is
replaced by U. The amino acid sequence
in the polypeptide chain is also linear and
parallel to the base sequence in the gene
or mRNA, but the chemical languages are
different: language written in four letters
to a language written in 20 letters. This is

into sequence of RNA. In synthesis of polypeptide “~“—
the gene is not directly converted into polypeptide,
but involves an RNA molecule to pass the message
in DNA to a message in polypeptide. Since the RNA molecule acts as a messenger to communicate
the information from DNA to polypeptide, it is called messenger RNA (mRNA). The two steps in
polypeptide synthesis are:
1, Transcription - Copying a sequence of DNA into mRNA
2. Translation — Converting the information in mRNA to a sequence of amino acids
Transcription is similar to replication since a DNA strand is acting as a template to make a
complementary mRNA strand. The difference in transcription is that the copy isa mRNA molecule
and only one DNA strand is copied. The major enzyme catalyzing polymerization is named as
RNA polymerase. This is mRNA, because it transmits the message stored in the gene to the place
where the polypeptide chain is actually being assembled. 
Message in mRNA is translated to a sequence of amino acids. This process occurs in association
with ribosomes, which are present in the cytosol.
In addition to mRNA, other types of RNAs and enzymes are involved in the polypeptide synthesis.
The basic mechanism of the process of polypeptide synthesis is similar in prokaryotes and
eukaryotes, with some important differences.
Genetic Code
In transcription, each letter of the template will be copied to the corresponding letter in mRNA.
Note that the mRNA is complementary to template, and hence it is a copy of the other DNA
strand. This seems to be straight forward, one to one copying. On the other hand, language of
nucleic acid has four letters (nucleotides), whereas the language of protein has 20 letters (amino
acids). If each kind of nucleotide is translated into amino acid, only four amino acids would be
specified or coded. Therefore a combination of nucleotides would be needed to code for one
amino acid. It has been proven by experiment that amino acids are coded by triplets of nucleotide
bases and the protein synthesis is based on a triplet code. Therefore, the genetic code is a triplet
code. If three-letter combinations or triplets are considered, 4° = 64 possibilities are there. The
three letter words or triplets are read one after the other, and hence are non-overlapping. Since all
the words have three letters, no space is required to delimit the words. The genetic code stored
in a gene in non-overlapping three-letter word is copied to non-overlapping, three-letter word in
complementary mRNA. This is translated by reading three letters at a time identifying an amino
acid corresponding to each three-letter word (Figure 7.16). The triplet of nucleotide bases of
mRNA either coding for an amino acid or a termination signal is called a codon. Therefore the
genetic code has 64 codons.
Out of 64, 61 triplets code for 20 amino acids, and the other three are used to signal the “stop” of
translation or as “termination” codons (UAA, UAG and UGA). AUG codon codes for methionine
(Met) as “start codon” signaling the protein synthesizing machinery to start translation of
mRNA at that codon. Therefore, the first amino acid of all protein is methionine, but this may be
enzymatically removed after the translation. Figure 7.16 shows all 64 codons and what each of
them codes for. It is easily noticeable that certain amino acids are coded by more than one codon. 
To read a message accurately, a starting point and a termination point as well as correct sequence
of letters should be identified. This is called a reading frame. The protein synthesizing machinery
starts and ends reading at precise positions and reads triplets one after the other in a nonoverlapping fashion. Since all words are three letter ones, no spaces between words are required.
If the reading starts at a wrong place, entirely wrong message will be read and a wrong polypeptide
will be synthesized. If one letter is missing or one letter is added in the reading frame, the wrong
message will be read from that point onwards, once again making a wrong polypeptide, if at all.
The reading of the message is always from left to right by convention.
Another interesting feature of the genetic code is that its universality. This means nearly all
organisms share the same genetic code. Accordingly, a gene isolated from one organism and
inserted in to another related or nonrelated organism should express the same protein. This is how
human insulin is produced by bacteria. The reading frame for insulin protein will be translated
in exactly the same way in both human and bacterial cells. A firefly gene can be expressed in
tobacco plant, so that the plant emits light","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
107,Molecular Biology and Recombinant DNA Technology,Mechanism of Polypeptide Synthesis,"I. Transcription
Transcription is DNA directed RNA synthesis. This is completed in three steps.
1. Initiation: The process of transcription is initiated at a specific site called promoter. The
promoter site includes a transcription initiation site and several other nucleotides. Only
one strand of the double stranded DNA acts as a template for transcription. This is because
only the template strand will have the promoter sequence in the correct orientation, which
facilitates the binding of RNA polymerase. The enzyme polymerizing the RNA is RNA
polymerase. This enzyme binds to the promoter site in correct orientation. The RNA
polymerase then unwinds the two DNA strands and begins the transcription at start point.
A component of RNA polymerase has the helicase activity, and hence DNA helicase is
not involved in transcription. 
2. Elongation: RNA polymerase enzymes can start adding complementary ribonucleotides
against the template DNA. RNA polymerase continues to add nucleotides in 5’ to 3°
direction until it reaches the transcription termination site. The DNA strands unwinds as
the RNA polymerase moves forward, exposing template DNA and allowing pairing with
ribonucleotide. The two strands rewind at the other end 
3. Termination: In prokaryotes, the polymerization continues passing the termination sequence
of DNA and RNA polymerase enzyme falls off ending the transcription..
After termination, the newly synthesized pre mRNA in eukaryotes is subjected to RNA
processing. The mature RNA leaves the nucleus. 

II. Translation
Once the mRNA is in the cytosol, translation process is initiated. Ribosomes read the message
written as a sequence of triplet codons in an mRNA and translate it into a sequence of amino acids
in a polypeptide with the assistance of transfer RNAs (tRNA). A tRNA attached to the correct
amino acid from a pool in the cytosol, transports it to the ribosome which adds the amino acid to
the growing end of the polypeptide chain by making a peptide bond. The key players in translation
are tRNAs .
A specific tRNA molecule binds a specific amino acid to its one end. Its structure also carries, at
a specific location, a triplet of nucleotides, which is complementary to the codon in the MRNA
that code for the amino acid it carries. This triplet is known as anticodon and it can base-pair with
the codon (figure 7.18). This is how tRNA does the translation, by acting as an adapter molecule
between the triplet codon and the amino acid specified by it.

Process of translation
The translation is also completed in three stages.
1.  Initiation: The first step in initiation is binding of small subunit of ribosome to MRNA
and to the initiator tRNA which carries methionine as the first amino acid. Then, the two
subunits of the ribosome combine to form the functional ribosome. This complex of
ribosomal subunits, mRNA and initiator tRNA, is called translation initiation complex
(Figure 7.20). Then the mRNA moves until the AUG start codon, aligns with the P site of
the large subunit. Then, the anticodon of the initiator tRNA forms hydrogen bonds with
AUG start codon. This signals the initiation of the translation. 
2. Elongation: In this stage, amino acids are added to the C- terminus of the growing
polypeptide chain by peptide bonds, one after the other governed by the triplet codons.
Elongation is completed by a three-step cycle. At the end of the initiation stage, P site
is occupied with tRNA attached to methionine and A site is empty and is aligned with
the next codon. The second tRNA, charged with the corresponding amino acid is brought
to the A site, matching the codon and anticodon. This first step in the cycle is the codon
recognition. As the second step, a peptide bond is formed between the carboxy! group of
the growing polypeptide chain in the P site with the amino group of the amino acid in the A
site. An rRNA catalyzes this reaction. The third step is the translocation of the mRNA. The
mRNA moves codon by codon unidirectionally. In the process, the tRNA with the growing
polypeptide chain in the A site is moved to the P site. The released tRNA in the P site will
move simultaneously to the E site, from where it is released to the cytosol. The A site is
now aligned with the next codon, so that this cyclic process can continue. GTP is used for
the energy requirement of the elongation process. See Figure 7.21 for an illustration of
elongation stage in translation. 
3.Termination: When the mRNA moves, it finally aligns one of the stop codons: UAG,
UAA or UGA with A site. They do not code for any amino acid, hence there is no tRNA
which comes into A site. This releases the completed polypeptide chain to the cytosol. The
ribosome and the remainder of the translation assemble then fall apart.

Polyribosomes/ Polysomes:
When the mRNA moves away for a sufficient distance, a second ribosome can bind to it. Depending
on the length of mRNA, a number of ribosomes can be attached to the mRNA simultaneously. As
such, mRNAs that are being translated actively are associated with multiple ribosomes attached
to a string of mRNA, forming polyribosomes or polysomes. Forming polyribosomes increases the
rate of translation since they allow simultaneous translation by several ribosomes.","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
108,Molecular Biology and Recombinant DNA Technology,Mutations,"The phenotype of an organism basically depends on the genetic information stored in DNA and
the final outcome is a result of the interaction between genetics of the organisms and the effects
of the environment.

Alterations in DNA may bring about certain changes in the characters
of individuals in a species, which result in phenotypic variation
among organisms. These changes occur permanently, and are called ( nucleotide sequence
mutations. 
Significance of mutation in Evolution

Mutations are the sources of variation seen among individuals of a species.
The effect of a mutation may be neutral, beneficial or deleterious. Deleterious mutations may be
lethal or at least they are less favorable than the original phenotype. A mutation may also cause
complete loss of a function. In rare occasions, the function of a polypeptide may be enhanced
due to a mutation. These are beneficial mutations. Entirely new functions may also be resulted by
mutations. For example, an enzyme specific to a substrate may change due to mutation in such
a way that it changes its specificity to act on another substrate. The product due to the mutation
is capable of catalyzing a new biochemical reaction. Beneficial mutations may contribute to the
evolution of organisms.

Types of mutation

There are two major types of mutations based on the scale of alterations in the genetic material;
small-scale changes occurring in the sequence of nucleotides in a gene or large-scale changes in
the number or the structure of chromosomes. These are known as gene mutations and chromosome
aberrations or chromosome mutations, respectively. 
Gene mutations
The permanent alterations of DNA sequence of a gene are called gene mutations. They may be
occurred due to rare errors occur during DNA replication. These are called spontaneous mutations.
In addition, certain external factors can also cause mutations at a higher rate. Since these factors
generate mutations, they are called mutagens. Mutagenic agents can be classified as chemical or
physical factors. X-rays and UV rays are examples for mutagenic physical agents.
The mutagenic agents can introduce changes to nucleotide sequences of DNA and cause mutations
during replication of the DNA in a cell. Mutations are also the cause of carcinogenesis. Therefore,
mutagens are carcinogens and carcinogens are mutagens. These chemicals and radiations need to
be handled with utmost care.

Types of Gene Mutations

These are small-scale mutations involving only one nucleotide pair or more than one nucleotide
pair. If only one pair is altered, these are called point mutations. There are three types of gene
mutations. They are:
1. A single nucleotide pair substitution — change one nucleotide pair with another
2. Nucleotide pair insertions — addition of one or more nucleotide pairs
3. Nucleotide pair deletions — removal of one or more nucleotide pairs
The substitution of a pair of nucleotide is a point mutation. Insertions or deletions can be point
mutations, or may involve more than one nucleotide pair.
Substitution
Here one nucleotide pair is replaced by another pair (Figure 7.23). There is no change in the
length of the gene and hence, the polypeptide. Because the same amino acid may be coded by
more than one codon. Some substitutions are silent mutations. Substitution of one nucleotide
pair of a gene may not have an effect on the polypeptide it codes for. Because the same amino
acid may be coded by more than one codons. The third letter in the codon triplet has a wobble,
meaning that even if the third letter of a codon is replaced by another letter the same amino acid is
coded in the third letter (for example, the codon 5’- GGC-3’ on the mRNA will be modified to 5’-
GGU-3’, if 3’-CCG-S’ triplet on the DNA template strand be altered as 3’°-CCA-5’ by substitution
G with A). A substitution may also change one amino acid in the polypeptide. Therefore, the
meaning of the primary structure of the polypeptide is changed slightly; hence, these mutations
are missense mutations. This substitution of the amino acid with another amino acid may or may
not have significant impact on the tertiary or quaternary structure (functional form) of the protein.
Occasionally, this may render the protein a higher activity or even with new properties. However,
very often, these changes are either neutral or detrimental mutations make the proteins useless or
less efficient. t is also, possible that a point mutation converts a codon coding for an amino acid to a stop codon.
This causes premature termination of the protein synthesis, and therefore it is called non-sense
mutation (figure 7.23). The result is a shorter polypeptide than original, which is usually non
functional. 

Insertion and deletion

These mutations bring about drastic changes in polypeptides compared to substitutions (note:
nonsense mutations due to substitutions may also result in major changes). Insertion or deletion
of a nucleotide or a couple of nucleotides will result in shift in the reading frame, reading wrong
codons after the point of mutation. Therefore, such mutations are called frameshift mutations
(figure 7.23), resulting in extensive missense. The polypeptide may not be functional at all, unless
the insertion or deletion occurred is very close to the termination codon. It may also introduce
a new stop codon, which was not in the original sequence. If that is the case, the translation
terminates causing nonsense mutation. However, if the insertion or deletion is a triplet or a
multiple triplet, the reading frame, will be back to the original reading frame immediately after the
point mutation (Figure 7.23). In such cases, one or a small number of amino acids will be added
or removed, respectively from the entire sequence. The message will only be slightly changed
and the polypeptide may be functional, depending on the importance of the mutated region of the
polypeptide in its correct folding. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
109,Molecular Biology and Recombinant DNA Technology,Chromosome Aberrations/ Chromosome Mutations,"Since many genes are involved, most of the chromosomal mutations are lethal, while others are
deleterious. Spontaneous abortions or miscarriages in mammals occur due to unusual numbers
or structures of chromosomes. Such mutations also bring about various developmental disorders.
Beneficial chromosome mutations are extremely rare. In plants, some chromosomal mutations
cause beneficial variations.
I. Mutations due to alterations in chromosome structure:
Large chunks of chromosomes, which may include several genes to several hundred genes, may
be lost, moved to another chromosome (cut and paste), copied and moved to another chromosome
(copy and paste), or the orientation changed in chromosome mutations. These four types of
chromosome mutations are called deletion, translocation, duplication and inversion. The loss of a part of a chromosome removes several genes, and hence often these changes are
lethal. In translocation, there is no loss of total amount of DNA. However, the expression of
genes can be altered due to the change in the environment at the new location. The cutting of
the chromosome may occur within a gene, and if this happens, that gene cannot function. In
duplication, an extra piece of DNA carrying many genes is present in another location of the
genome. This situation may also alter the gene expression, usually leading to deleterious impacts
on the phenotype. The change of the orientation of a chunk of chromosome or inversions can also
result in changes in gene expression; most of these are adverse variations. 

II. Mutations due to alterations in chromosome number:
In addition to the structural changes of the chromosomes, a cell may contain an entire chromosome
or even a set of chromosomes in excess to the normal number of chromosomes. A cell may also get
one chromosome less than the normal number. When there is one more or one less chromosome in
a cell, that situation is referred to as aneuploidy. Here the ploidy level has not changed, but when
a complete set of chromosomes are present in excess, then ploidy level is said to be increased, for
example to triploid, tetraploid, hexaploid etc.
Aneuploidy is resulted in by the mistakes in meiosis. During meiosis |, the two sets of chromosomes
in a diploid cell must separate and move towards the two poles of the cell. However, due to
abnormal arrangement of homologous chromosomes, both chromosomes of a pair may migrate
to one pole, so the other end has one less chromosomes. The resulting cells or gametes in sexual
reproduction also have either one more or one less chromosomes than the haploid number of
chromosomes. A similar result is obtained when chromatids of a chromosome do not separate
and migrate to the opposite poles of the cell in meiosis II. The inability to separate a pair or pairs
of chromosomes in meiosis is called nondisjunction (Figure 7.25). When a gamete with one
less chromosomes, unites with a normal gamete, the resulting zygote is an aneuploid with 2n-1
chromosomes. This type of cells is called monosomic, since a specific chromosome has only one
of it. A gamete with one more than the usual haploid set of chromosomes may fuse with a normal
gamete. The zygote will carry a chromosome in triplicate, and hence 2n+1. This aneuploidy status
is called trisomic for that chromosome.
Such abnormalities can take place also in mitosis. Ploidy level can also increase by abnormal
separation of chromosomes. A triploid (3n) can result in fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg.
If a zygote does not divide into two daughter cells after the first steps in mitotic division, it will
carry four sets of chromosomes and be developed into a tetraploid (4n).
Animals with higher ploidy level are very rare. Plants on the other hand, can tolerate higher ploidy
levels, and often perform better than their diploid individuals.
Examples of plants having higher ploidy levels:
Banana — Triploid (3n); Wheat — hexaploid (6n); Strawberries — Octaploid (8n)
Polyploids are more common in invertebrates than in vertebrates. Among vertebrates, polyploidy
is observed in a few fishes and amphibians. 
Polyploids are rather normal compared to aneuploids. Although having higher number of
chromosomes than usual, polyploids maintain the genetic balance, whereas genetic balance is lost
in aneuploids. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
110,Molecular Biology and Recombinant DNA Technology,Human Genetic Disorders,"I. Due to Gene Mutations
Two examples of human genetic disorders by gene mutations are described below. 

Colour Blindness

Colour blindness or Colour Vision Deficiency is a genetic disorder, more common in males than
in females, due to mutations on one or more genes located in X chromosome. These genes code
for proteins that absorb different wavelengths of visible light. These are visual pigments called
photopsins, which are categorized as red, green or blue. A person with a normal colour vision can
distinguish different colours and their hues because they have all three categories of pigments in
the retina, The absorption of different proportions of different wavelengths by the pigments is
resolved by the brain as the colour of the object. In human genes coding red and green pigments
are located in X chromosomes and gene for blue pigment is on the chromosome 7. Since males
have only one X chromosome and the relevant genes are absent in Y chromosome, any defect
in one or both of these genes will make the phenotype. In females at heterozygous condition a
defective allele in one X chromosome is masked by the good allele in the other. Therefore colour
vision deficiency is more common in males (5-8% of males) than in females (less than 1% of
females). Colour blindness nearly always affects the perception of red or green colours, because
these are the genes that are sex linked.

Sickle Cell Aneamia

Sickle cell aneamia is a genetic disease prevalent in human populations in Africa and other warmer
regions of the world. A mutated allele of a gene coding for B -globin subunit of hemoglobin, the
oxygen carrying pigment, causes an abnormality of the hemoglobin molecules. The presence
of this abnormal hemoglobin in red blood cells changes the shape of the RBCs to curve as
a sickle from its disk-shape. Individuals with this disorder have fewer numbers of RBCs, and
hence develop aneamia. This is because the sickled RBCs breakdown prematurely. The mutation
substitutes glutamic acid at a particular place in the primary structure of the B globin with valine
(Figure 7.26), which results in abnormal folding of hemoglobin. The mutated allele is codominant,
which means both normal 8 globin and mutated B globin are produced in individuals who are the
heterozygous for this locus. Therefore, they have both good and bad hemoglobin and hence both
normal and sickled RBCs are present. They are normally healthy and are the carriers of the mutant
allele. Since the mutated alleles causes severely detrimental effects in homozygous individuals,
normally they should have been eliminated from the human population by natural selection.
However, there is prevalence of malaria in warmer countries like in Africa, the heterozygous
individuals will survive malaria attacks better than individuals with homozygous wild type alleles.
This is because, the malaria parasite can not survive in sickled RBCs. Therefore, at heterozygous
individuals, parasite density remains at a lower level. 

II. Due to Chromosomal Mutations
Chromosomal! mutations bring about drastic changes in amount of genetic material or chromosome
structure, leading to abortions of the fetus in mammals. If they survive, they show a peculiar set
of abnormal characteristics in the phenotype which are called syndromes.
Three genetic disorders of humans due to aneuploidy are described below.
Down syndrome:
Down syndrome is also known as trisomy -21, because the cells of the affected individual contain
an extra copy of chromosome 21. The syndrome shows characteristic facial features, short body,
heart defects (which can be corrected) and developmental delays. They have a high risk of
developing leukemia and Alzheimer disease. Almost all males and half of the females with Down
syndrome are sexually under developed and sterile. Their life span is shorter than normal, but can
live past middle age with proper medical treatment. However, they have a lower risk of high blood
pressure, atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), strokes and many types of solid tumors.
Despite their abnormalities, many live independently and are employed. The risk of having a baby
with Down syndrome increases with the age of the mother. This is caused by nondisjunction in
meiosis-I.
While Down syndrome is due to trisomy of an autosome, there are human genetic disorders due
to aneuploidy in sex chromosomes as well. The aneuploidy conditions in sex chromosomes cause
Turner syndrome due to monosomy and Klinefelter syndrome due to trisomy. 

Turner syndrome:
Turner syndrome is due to monosomy in X chromosome. In very rare cases, there are females
with only one X chromosome, and hence their genotype is XO. This is the only known viable
monosomy in humans. These individuals are phenotypically female, but they are sterile because
their sex organs do not mature. When girls affected with Turner syndrome are treated with estrogen
replacement therapy, they develop secondary sex characters.
They have a short stature and some may have an extra skin on the neck (webbed neck). Other
characters are puffiness or swelling (lymphedema) of the hands and feet, skeletal abnormalities,
heart defects, high blood pressure and kidney problems. Most of them have normal intelligence.

Klinefelter syndrome:
This is due to rare condition having an extra X chromosome in the genotype of XXY. Since
it carries a Y chromosome, these individuals are males. Although these people have male sex
organs, they are sterile. There testes are abnormally small. One out of the two X chromosomes
is inactivated. Yet these males may have enlarged breasts and may develop other female body
characteristics. They have subnormal (less than normal) intelligence.
XYY trisomy will make males and XXX trisomy will make female. They do not show any
syndrome and have normal male and female characteristics, respectively. They are fertile and
slightly taller than the average.

Genetic Counseling
Genetic counseling is a service which is important for families having genetic disorders or
families having a risk of genetic disorders. This service is intended to estimate the risk a couple
may have in conceiving a child with genetic disorders and providing necessary advice to avoid
such instances. Genetic counseling is a profession that requires, on one side, a good knowledge
of human genetics to understand, how traits obeying the rules of simple Mendelian inheritance
would behave and on the other side, an ability to provide guidance to minimize the risk of having
a child with a genetic disorder. If the family already has such a child, the genetic counselor would
also provide advice how to manage the situation and how to plan the birth of next child.
Some of the genetic disorders are multifactorial, which means several factors including multigene
inheritance and that is also affected by environment. For example, heart attacks and diabetes may
be inherited, but the risk of developing the disease is affected by external environmental factors
such as life style and food habits. As such, a clear pattern of inheritance of the disease cannot
be traced. The risk of the effect of a trait that follows simple Mendelian laws of inheritance on a child to be conceived can be estimated by studying the history of the family with regard to a
particular disorder, and hence, becomes the subject of genetic counseling. If the disorder is caused
by a dominant allele, it can easily be observed in the potential parents. However, if the allele is
recessive, a parent or both the parents with normal phenotype may be homozygous for dominant
allele or heterozygous carrier. Tracing the history of the family with regards to the disease using
pedigree analysis, would allow estimation of probability of parents being carriers and accordingly
would estimate the probability of the risk of having a child with the disorder. The information
available through pedigree analysis, sometimes is sufficient to determine exactly the genotype
of one or both parents. The genetic counselor explains the situation to the potential parents and
guides them to choose the most suitable option in having a child.
Techniques are now available to determine whether the already conceived fetus carries the mutant
alleles. For this, the cells of the early fetus are sampled and DNA is sequenced to find out the
presence or absence of the mutant allele and, if present, whether the fetus is homozygous or
heterozygous. This information is very important to take well informed decision to keep the
fetus or to abort it. Legislations of some countries allow abortions of such fetuses which would
otherwise be born with genetic disorders. This however is a difficult decision for parents to make.
Therefore genetic counselor has a task of guiding the potential parents to make the best decision
possible.","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
111,Molecular Biology and Recombinant DNA Technology,Gene Technology,"Tools, Techniques and Methods in Gene Technology

This section examines the process of gene technology starting from DNA isolation, through
identification of desired DNA sequences to gene technology or recombinant DNA technology.
The isolated DNA needs to be cut different pieces of DNA must be joined and at times DNA
must be copied in vitro. These involve several enzymes acting on DNA. Distinguishing a unique
DNA sequence from the rest of the DNA, requires separation of DNA based on the size of the
fragments and identification of it. In making genetically modified organisms, this DNA needs to
be transferred to a recipient organism using a suitable method. Copying of DNA is possible in
vivo using cloning and in vitro using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Sequencing of DNA has
become a very important technique in many studies in DNA.

Isolation of DNA

Gene technology begins with isolation of the target DNA sequence from the total genome of the
donor cells. Purified DNA is required for many applications such as studying DNA structure and
chemistry, examining DNA-protein interactions, carrying out DNA hybridizations, sequencing,
PCR, performing various genetic studies or gene cloning. 
Since DNA molecules are very long, the entire length of a DNA molecule cannot be isolated,
except for shorter DNA molecules such as plasmid DNA and viral DNA. However, breaking of
DNA or shearing has to be minimized during the extraction process.
The basic principles and major steps of DNA isolation can be identified as follows.
•	Homogenization or disruption of cells: DNA is located in the nucleus of the eukaryotic
cells and it is concentrated in nucleoid in prokaryotic cells. The first step in DNA isolation
is releasing the DNA from the cells by breaking cells or lysis of the cells. Cells can be lysed
by mechanical methods such as grinding and homogenization. Enzymatically by lysozyme
to break bacterial cell wall.
•	Inhibition of DNAse: When the cells are broken, the DNA may get in touch with DNA
degrading enzymes such as Deoxyribonuclease (DNAse). Therefore, DNA must be
protected from such enzymes causing shearing. Chelating agents are added to remove
metal ions required for nuclease activity.
•	Dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes: DNA needs to be freed from the proteins that
bind to DNA. DNA-protein interactions are disrupted with detergents such as SDS, phenol,
or proteolytic enzymes.
•	Removal of contaminating materials: All other molecules in a cell are contaminants of
DNA. Removal of this contaminants is required for some applications.
•	Precipitation of DNA: Here the DNA dissolved in aqueous phase is precipitated with cold
ethanol. The precipitate is usually re-dissolved in a buffer. RNA is removed by limited
treatment with DNAse free RNAase (ribonuclease).

Enzymes Reacting with DNA

Enzymes are required in cutting, joining and copying of DNA in vitro.
1. Restriction endonucleases: There are several different types of nucleases in cells having
different functions. In gene technology, cutting DNA at precise locations is important.
The enzymes that recognize specific sequences of DNA and cuts at or near these sites are
called restriction endonucleases. The position where the DNA sequence is cut 1s called as
restriction site or cleavage site (Figure 7.28).
e.g. EcoRI- Source: E. coli
2.DNA Ligase: Cut DNA fragments from different sources are joined together by forming a
phosphodiester bond by DNA ligase to obtain recombinant DNA molecules (Figure 7.27).
T4 DNA ligase is the most commonly used DNA joining enzyme in gene technology. The
source of this enzyme is T4 bacteriophage.
3. DNA Polymerases: These are enzymes that add complementary deoxyribonucleotides to
the template strand in a growing DNA strand, so that they copy DNA. These are therefore
very important in gene technology especially in PCR and DNA sequencing. The most
widely used DNA polymerase is Taq DNA polymerase. This is a heat stable enzyme isolated
originally from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquaticus. 

In addition to the enzymes reacting with DNA, enzymes which can make DNA on an RNA
template is also very useful in gene technology. These enzymes are called reverse transcriptase,
because their action is the reverse of the transcription. This is used to make cDNA (copy DNA or
complementary DNA) on an mRNA template.
The DNA shearing or cutting with restriction enzymes makes a mixture of DNA fragments
of different sizes. In DNA fingerprinting, using PCR, DNA strands having different sizes are
obtained. Therefore in many applications with DNA, separation of DNA molecules becomes
important. Separation of fragments having different size on a gel matrix is the most practical way
of doing this.

Agarose gel electrophoresis: Electrophoresis is a technique that separates large charged
molecules, (such as DNA, RNA and proteins) according to their mobility in an electric field.
The speed of a molecule moving in an electric field depends on its net charge and the size. In gel
electrophoresis, the molecules are moving through small pores of a matrix of gel. This restricts
the movement of the molecules and helps in separation according to the size; larger molecules
move slowly compared to smaller molecules. In the case of nucleic acids, the net charge depends
on the length of the molecule, and therefore the separation is based on the size. For the separation
of DNA, Agarose Gel Electrophoresis is the most frequently used technique. Agarose is purified
agar, obtained from a type of seaweed. This forms a polysaccharide matrix. In the Agarose gel
electrophoresis equipment, the gel is placed in buffer and a cathode and an anode are placed
on either end of the gel (Figure 7.29(a)). When a current is applied using a power supply, the
negatively charged DNA molecules migrate towards the anode through the gel. When preparing
the gel, wells are formed, and the DNA is loaded into these wells. The separated DNA can be
stained by ethidium bromide and be visualized by exposing to UV light.

Although stains like ethidium bromide show the presence of double stranded DNA band on an
agarose gel, those stains cannot differentiate a band with a specific nucleotide sequence from the
others, In order to identify such a band among many other bands, a DNA probe is used.
DNA Probes and hybridization: A DNA probe is a fragment of single stranded labeled DNA
used to detect the presence of complementary nucleic acid sequences by hybridization. Labeling
is a modification of the DNA strand in such a way that it gives a signal which enables the detection
of that DNA strand. The labeling can be done by, for example, incorporation of a radioactive
isotope, or addition of a fluorescent molecule to the structure of the probe. This single stranded
DNA stretch can hybridize to complementary single strand of DNA or RNA. Therefore before
hybridizing with the probe, the double stranded DNA needs to be denatured to make room for
the probe. The denatured bands on the gel need to be transferred to a nitrocellulose or nylon filter
membrane by a process called Southern Blotting. The bands are then fixed to the membrane. Then
the labeled probe is added to the membrane and allowed to renature. The probes will bind strongly
only to the complementary sequences, which are fixed to the membrane. When the membrane
is washed, the probe is removed except the probes bound to the bands with target nucleotide
sequence. If the probe is radioactively labelled, the band with the target sequence can be identified
by autoradiography of the membrane. If the probe is labeled with a fluorescent dye, the band can
be identified using UV light. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
112,Molecular Biology and Recombinant DNA Technology,DNA Cloning,"In DNA cloning, the DNA replication machinery of a host cell is used to copy the desired DNA.
However, inserting a fragment of DNA into a host cell will not be copied, unless an origin of
replication (Ori) is present in that. Therefore, in order to replicate the recombinant DNA molecule
or DNA of interest, it has to be combined with DNA with Ori and that can be replicated independent
of the chromosomal DNA (chromosomal DNA replicates only once in a cell division). In a
bacterial host, there are several copies of plasmids and also when infected with a bacteriophage, a
large number of copies of viral DNA per bacterial cell are present. As such the DNA molecule of
interest can be integrated into these self-replication units, which are called vectors.

Vectors: The vectors are vehicles to carry the DNA of interest into a host for multiplication
or cloning. The vectors used in cloning of DNA are called cloning vectors. When the vector is
carrying the foreign DNA, it is called a recombinant vector.
Making a recombinant vector also follows the same procedure for making the recombinant DNA
molecule. Here the gene of interest has to be cut with a restriction enzyme and the vector (plasmid
or the viral DNA) should also be cut with the same enzyme. These two should be mixed and
allowed to integrate and ligated using DNA ligase (Figure 7.30). The site in the vector, where the
DNA to be cloned is inserted is a called cloning site. In order to be able to use several restriction
enzymes to cut DNA (both the vector and the DNA to be cloned), the cloning site contains a
sequence which carry sites for many restriction enzymes. Therefore, this is called multiple cloning
site. A host cell, usually a bacterial host which can copy the vector, is then transformed by the
recombinant vector. The host then will copy the plasmid carrying the DNA of interest. A number
of recombinant plasmid is present in each descendent cell of the colony of bacterial host. 

Types of vectors and their differences

Any self-replicating unit in a particular host cell can be used as a vector. In bacteria, plasmids and
bacteriophages are used as vectors. Plasmids are present in yeast cells also. Therefore they can
also be used as vectors in yeast. The yeast cloning vectors are called yeast artificial chromosomes
or YACs,. they are plasmids, but are called chromosomes, because they carry sequences of
centromeres. They work as chromosomes when they are linearized. In addition, they also have
autonomously replicating sequences (ARS) to enable them to replicate independent of the cell
division. All of these vectors carry genes which are not necessary for a vector. These are removed
and this space is used to insert the DNA of interest. The yeast vectors should contain sequence of
centromere and autonomously replicating sequences (ARS).
As described above, main purpose of cloning vector is to copy DNA in an in vivo system. For
this, number of copies in a single host has to be high. So this condition is fulfilled by bacterial
plasmids, bacteriophages and YACs. The transformation of cells is a very inefficient process.
However, using bacteriophages as vectors overcome this problem, because the vector can be
inserted to the host cell by the mechanism of infection of the bacteriophage. An advantage of
YACs is that they are large, therefore, large amount of DNA can be copied using them. It has also
another advantage, because they operate in the eukaryotic system. 

The copies of the DNA of interest or recombined DNA is retrieved by harvesting the host cells,
releasing the vectors by lysis, isolation of the vectors and cutting the DNA with the same
restriction enzymes that was used originally to isolate the fragment of DNA. The recombinant
DNA is then isolated after separation and detection on an agarose gel after electrophoresis.
Use of marker genes: The efficiency of the transformation of the host cells with the recombinant
plasmid vector is very low. This means, that for one transformed host cell, there are millions or
billions of cells that are not transformed. Both transformed and untransformed cells will make colonies in a suitable medium, but these cannot be distinguished. Therefore, some sort of marker
gene should be engineered into the cloning vector, so that the few colonies originating from the
transformed cells can be screened among many untransformed cells. Most common markers are
antibiotic resistance genes. The host cell is sensitive to the particular antibiotic, and hence will not
grow on a medium containing the antibiotic. Since the vector is carrying the gene for resistance,
the transformed cells can grow in the medium with antibiotic. Such markers are called selectable
markers, since they allow the growth of only the transformed cells.
There is another problem to be solved. The transformation does not necessarily mean that the
insert is there. Not all vectors are recombined with the gene of interest. Therefore, another marker
is required to distinguish the colonies with the vector containing the insert from those with vector
only. The second marker located at the multiple cloning site becomes inactive due to the insertion. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
113,Molecular Biology and Recombinant DNA Technology,DNA Libraries,"When a genome is cut into random pieces by shearing using mechanical force or by restriction
enzymes, it creates an extremely large number of different sequences, depending on the size of
the genome. All these pieces can be integrated into cloning vectors and the recombinant vectors
can be used to transform bacterial hosts. These hosts can then be cultivated in a suitable medium
for selection of transformed cells and screening for transformed cells with vectors carrying an
insert. Since there was no selection for a particular segment of DNA in this case, each transformed
cell with an insert may carry a different piece of DNA of the genome selected earlier. When all
colonies are isolated and cultivated separately, the collection of these colonies is referred to as a
genomic DNA library (Figure 7.32). DNA libraries are, a collection of microbial cultures each
propagating a different fragments of a total genomic DNA which are cloned in a population of identical vectors. Inserts of each colony can be sequenced separately in order to have a complete
sequence of the genome. This is how the elucidation of sequence human genome under the
Human Genome Project started. 
There is another type of DNA libraries. These are called cDNA libraries. These libraries contain
complementary DNA obtained by reverse transcription of the mRNAs isolated from cells/ tissues.
Collection of mRNAs of a cell is called transcriptome. mRNAs are isolated and reverse transcribed
into a DNA strand complementary to the mRNAs. The enzyme used here is reverse transcriptase.
The second DNA strand is replicated on the first DNA template using DNA polymerase to obtain
double stranded cDNA. The DNA fragments are cloned and similar procedure is followed as for
genomic DNA library in order to construct a cDNA library. 
DNA libraries are basically used as sources of DNA fragments for sequencing. cDNA libraries
also reflect the pattern of expression of genes.
DNA Delivery Systems
A cell contacting foreign DNA is called a transformed cell. Getting the foreign DNA in a cell can
be done using several methods.
e ‘Transformation: In this method a large number of copies of DNA of interest is mixed (e.g.
a recombined vector) with host cells. This is based on the ability of a cell to take up DNA
from its surroundings through the cell membrane. The efficiency is very low in getting
the DNA into the cells. Various treatments can increase the competency (ability to take up
DNA from outside) of host cells.
e Transduction: This method is based on the ability of bacteriophages to infect host cells.
Viruses infecting plants and animals can also be used as vectors to deliver foreign DNA
into plant and animal hosts. The gene of interest is integrated into the modified viral
genome and packaged into the protein capsid. This viral particle can pass the recombined
DNA as in its normal infection process. The capsid protects the DNA and this method is
more efficient than transformation.
e Gene Gun: In this method, small particles of a heavy metal such as gold are coated with
a large number of copies of the DNA of interest and the particles are shot at high velocity
into the cells to be transformed. The equipment used is the gene gun 

agrobacterium mediated gene transfer: Agrobacterium is a soil bacterium which can infect
plants. Their mode of infection is very special. The infection causes a tumor on the plant, and
the bacterium is living inside it. The disease is called crown gall disease. The cells in the tumor
or gall are actually genetically transformed by a segment of a plasmid of Agrobacterium. This
plasmid is called Ti (tumor inducing) plasmid (Figure 7.34). A part of this plasmid can actually
be transferred to plant genome, and hence called transfer DNA or T-DNA. T-DNA contains genes
which induce formation of a tumor and also characters associated with pathogenicity. What is
needed for transfer of the DNA is the right and left boarder sequences of the T-DNA. Therefore scientists have removed most of the bacterial genes, including virulent genes from T-DNA and
have made room for inserting genes of interest into this space between the two border sequences.
Agrobacterium can deliver this modified T-DNA with inserted gene to plant cells through its
infection ability. However plant cells will not become sick because the virulent genes have been
removed from T-DNA. This is called disarming the T-DNA. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
114,Molecular Biology and Recombinant DNA Technology,DNA Analysis,"When the morphological characters are used to classify, the number of characters available is
limited, so that usually the smallest group identified is a species. When more characters are
available, more divisions such as subspecies, strains, varieties etc. become possible. Biochemical
properties (i.e. enzyme activities) are useful characters in classification to separate organisms into
smaller groups. Since characters are controlled by the combination of the genetics of the organism
and its environment, above mentioned characters may vary depending on the environment. Hence
if one needs to look how two groups of organisms are similar or different genetically, he has to
investigate at the DNA level.
Various techniques for DNA analysis have been developed to facilitate the identification of genetic
similarities and differences among organisms and some of these can be used even to identify an
individual. These techniques are used in conjunction with techniques such as DNA isolation, gel
electrophoresis and use of probes that were discussed above. 

Restriction Maps
As shown earlier, restriction enzymes cut dsDNA into fragments at specific sequences. Depending
on the number of restriction sites and where they are located, a number of fragments of varying
sizes will be generated. Different restriction enzymes cut at different sites and generate different
numbers of fragments having different sizes. A restriction map is a diagram showing the position
of each restriction site with respect to each other and the distance between these sites (Figure
7.35). Distances can be measured by cM (centi Morgans ) or number of base pairs. Restriction maps are very important in construction of cloning vectors: Cloning vectors are cut by
restriction enzymes at the cloning site to insert the fragments of DNA from other sources to the
cloning site 

DNA Sequencing
A DNA molecule is made of two complementary and antiparallel strands each comprising four
bases; adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine, arranged linearly in a sequence. DNA sequencing
is a process to determine the precise order of these bases in a DNA molecule. 
The techniques have been improved greatly since the introduction of DNA sequencing in 1977.
The technology of DNA sequencing that was available by the time of obtaining the sequence
of entire human genome in 2003, under the human genome project was called first generation
sequencing technology. Those methods were time consuming and it was possible to determine
the sequence only of short DNA fragments. The technology developed since then to next
generation sequencing or second generation sequencing and to the most modern third generation
sequencing technology. The most modern technology can sequence strands of lengths of millions
of nucleotides, and therefore, the time required for sequencing has reduced greatly. Although the
Human Genome Project took 15 years to complete the sequencing of human genome, one can
today obtain his/ her genome sequenced in several hours at a cost 1000 US$ (2018).
With the development of the technology of DNA sequencing, its applications also have been
widened. 
Applications of DNA sequencing

Molecular Biology: Information on base sequence of DNA is important in understanding the
functions of DNA. Genes coding for a polypeptide can be located by studying the DNA sequence.
Certain domains in the DNA sequence of a gene specify the function of the protein. For example,
whether the protein will be a transmembrane protein or whether it is a DNA binding protein. DNA
sequencing has revealed the presence of multiple copies of genes in human genome. Although
amino acid sequence of a peptide can be determined using an amino acid sequencer, it has now
become easier to work out the amino acid sequence via DNA sequence.
Evolutionary biology: DNA is passed from generation to generation. Over time, changes occur
and accumulated in the DNA. Therefore the similarities and differences in the sequences of DNA
of individuals within a species and among different species reveal their evolutionary relationships.
Sequencing of DNA samples obtained from ancient humans remains preserved, for example, as
mummies or buried in ice or as fossilized remains has given insight into when the Homo sapiens
evolved, and how they migrated to conquer the world. 
Medicine: Certain families inherit some genetic disorders. Sequencing of DNA reveals if a healthy
person is a carrier or not. How a particular disease causing allele is distributed among family
members is very important in assessing the risk and to plan a management. Similarly diagnosis of
cancer is also possible through DNA sequencing. The response to a drug given for cancer can be
followed by sequencing DNA carried in the blood of a patient. If a drug is responding, then the
DNA sequences related to cancer must be reduced in blood. DNA isolated from a placenta of a
fetus is useful in early diagnosis of presence of genetic disorders. 
Forensics: Except for identical twins, it is extremely rare that two individuals share exactly the
same sequence of DNA. That means DNA sequencing can identify an individual having the same
DNA sequences as DNA material from (blood, hair, sperm, saliva etc) found in a crime scene.
Similarly paternity testing is another use of DNA sequencing.

Metagenomics: Microbiome is the totality of microorganisms in a particular habitat including
human body and different environments. Conventional methods for studying the microorganisms
in a microbiome are based on culturing in pure cultures. However, a large number of microorganisms
are unculturable and hence, are largely neglected. Metagenomics is a science in which total DNA
present in an environment is extracted as community DNA and studying this sample as a whole.
Sequencing some specific sequences in this community DNA and analysis using suitable software,
will reveal the number of different species and their identity. Some of these are presently known
and many others may be new species. Therefore, metagenomics studies are important in ecology,
epidemiology and other fields. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
115,Molecular Biology and Recombinant DNA Technology,DNA Fingerprinting,"The unique set of genetic markers of an individual makes its DNA fingerprint or genetic profile.
The presence/ absence of markers are nowadays determined by mostly PCR using specific primers
for the marker (see below). These markers are called Small Tandem Repeats (STR markers) or
Microsatellite DNA. Eukaryotic DNA contains some non-coding sequences where two to six base
pairs are repeated tandemly (one after the other) 100 to 1000 times, so that the lengths of these
repeats vary. Since they are non-coding, variations do not have an impact on phenotype. These are
variable in individuals, so that can be used as makers. The advantages of using STR markers are
•	they occur frequently in genome
•	 easily amplified by PCR
•	 highly variable polymorphisms and
•	 a large number of characterized STRs are available.
The method used earlier was probing specific sequences using labeled markers as describes earlier
(see DNA Probes and hybridization).
In DNA profiling, a set of markers (probes or PCR primers) is used, A DNA fingerprint cannot be
obtained by using one marker, since there are many individuals with the same banding pattern.
When more and more markers are used in combination, the probability of finding the same pattern
reduced. It has been calculated that, if 13 markers are used the probability becomes between 10
billion to several trillions. Since the world population is in the region of seven billion, it is highly
unlikely that two individuals to have the same genetic profile/ fingerprint. 
Applications of DNA Fingerprinting

Criminal identification and victim identification (Figure 7.37) — The fingerprints of the suspects
are matched with fingerprints obtained from biological material obtained from a crime scene. The
expert’s opinion on the identity of the criminal is accepted by the Courts of law. 

Paternity testing (Figure 7.38). The DNA fingerprint of a child is never identical to that of either
the father or the mother. However, the child shares some markers from the father and others
from the mother. Therefore, when the paternity of a child is in question, DNA profiling can be
accurately used to confirm or rule out a person as the father of that particular child 

Identifying infectious agents: When probes or primers are known to obtain the fingerprint of a
pathogenic infectious organism, DNA fingerprinting can detect the presence or absence of this
organism in the patient or in food or water. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
116,Molecular Biology and Recombinant DNA Technology,Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR),"Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is used to copy sequences of DNA in vitro, mimicking the
DNA replication. As in replication, a DNA polymerase enzyme is needed to catalyze the reaction
of elongation of the new DNA strand. The raw materials needed are the deoxyribonucleotide
triphosphate (dNTPs), which are the four deoxyribonucleotides (dATP, dGTP, dTTP and dCTP).
A single stranded template DNA is required. Since the DNA polymerase cannot initiate DNA
replication, a primer is also needed. In PCR, a primer is a specific sequence of DNA with a small
number of nucleotides (oligonucleotide) which is complementary to a sequence at 3’ end of the
target DNA to be copied. To copy both the strands two primers, each binding to either of the two
strands at 3’ end, are used. In the cell, the primer is an RNA sequence. In addition to these, Mg?""
is also required. These become the ingredients in PCR mix. The DNA fragment in which the sequence to be copied is present in dsDNA, and hence it needs
to be denatured. Denaturation is done by heating the PCR mix to 95 °C. At this temperature
most of the enzymes will denature, and therefore it may be necessary to add DNA polymerase
after the denaturation. However, the enzymes of the thermophilic organisms are resistant to high
temperature. Therefore, the common heat resistant DNA polymerase used in PCR is Taq DNA
polymerase which is obtained from thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquaticus. The primer will
bind to the complementary sequence of the denatured template DNA. This happens at a lower
temperature and this step is called annealing. The annealing temperature will depend on the
sequence and the length of the primer. Once the annealing of the primer is achieved, then the
primer extension (DNA synthesis) will take place at a different temperature. This is the optimum
temperature of the DNA polymerase used. When sufficient time is given, a complementary copy
of the template DNA is completed. At the end of this first thermal cycle (denaturation, annealing
and extension temperatures), one copy of each strand is produced. However, these are longer than
the intended copy of the target DNA sequence (Figure 7.39). After a couple of PCR cycle, an exact
copy of the target DNA is synthesized. After this, copies of the target DNA will be produced in
an exponential manner (i.e. 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) after each cycle. A typical PCR will have 35 to 40
cycles. At the end, millions of copies of the desired DNA sequence will be produced from a single
template DNA molecule. 
PCR is an essential technique in cloning procedure which allows generation of large amounts of
pure DNA from tiny amount of template strand and further study of a particular gene.
Applications of PCR
•	Analyzing clinical specimens for the presence of infectious agents (e.g. HIV, hepatitis,
malaria)
•	Analysis of mutations causing genetic diseases. (e.g. cystic fibrosis, sickle cell aneamia,
phenylketonuria)
•	Used in forensics laboratories. Since PCR can make a large number of copies from a small
number of template DNA, it is especially useful because only a tiny amount of original
DNA is required (e.g. droplet of blood or a single hair).
•	PCR is an essential technique in cloning procedure which allows generation of large
amounts of pure DNA from tiny amount of template strand and further study of a particular
gene.
•	Sequencing of DNA depends on PCR.
•	PCR has been used to identify, and to explore relationships among species in the field of
evolutionary biology.
•	In anthropology, it is also used to understand the ancient human migration patterns. In
archaeology, it has been used to spot the ancient human race.
•	PCR commonly used by paleontologists to amplify DNA from extinct species or
cryopreserved fossils of millions of years old, and can thus be further studied to elucidate
on their evolutionary relationships. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
117,Molecular Biology and Recombinant DNA Technology,Applications of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs),"The host with the extra trait introduced by genetic engineering techniques is called a genetically
modified organism (GMO). Some related terms are Genetically Engineered Microorganisms
(GEMs), transgenic organisms and living modified organisms (LMOs). The food and feed
obtained from GMOs are called Genetically Modified Food (GMF). Since majority of the crop
plants, farm animals and pets animals used today are genetically modified by domestication, it is
important to note that what is referred to as GMOs in today’s context are essentially the organisms
derived as a result of rDNA technology.

(Note: It is important to realize that animal cloning is not a gene technology. It does not include
any of the above mentioned steps.)
The steps in the process making a genetically modified plant or an animal are as follows.
1. Identification of a suitable gene
2. Isolation and purification of the gene
3. Amplification of the gene by cloning
4. In vitro modifications of the gene of interest
5. Amplification of modified gene by cloning
6. Transformation of the recipient cells (microbial cells, cells or protoplasts of plants or
fertilized eggs of animals)
7. Screening for expression of the inserted gene
8. Monitoring for stable integration of the modified gene
9. Backcrossing to introduce the new trait to other varieties of crops and breeds of animals
The applications of gene technology can be found in many fields, including agriculture, medicine
and industry.

Applications of GMO in Agriculture.

With the growing human population and decrease in agriculture land, it becomes obvious that ,
the crop yield per unit area needs to be increased. In order to achieve an economically sustainable
agriculture, a higher crop yield should be obtained with a low cost of production. Improving
the quality of foods is also a major concern in agriculture, in addition to the quantity. The green
revolution from 1930s to 1960s increased the crop yield by introducing high yielding crops and
use of artificial fertilizer and pesticides. However, impact of green revolution is also limited and
is now being overcome by the genetically modified plants (GM crops). When a single plant cell is
genetically modified, it can be regenerated in a plant, as plant cells are totipotent. When a useful
trait is introduced into a crop, it can be introduced to other varieties of the same crop by plant
breeding. 

Most significant contributions in crop yield enhancement by gene technology in agriculture are
due to the production of GM crops that are resistant to
• pests and diseases
• herbicides and
• environmental stresses.

In addition, crops with higher nutritional values are also available, e.g. golden rice enriched with
vitamin A, increased triglycerides content in Canola oil.

Plants Resistant to Pests: Several GM crops have been engineered with a gene producing a toxic
protein that kills the plant eating larval stages of certain lepidopteron and coleopteron insects.
Most widely cultivated pest resistant GM plants are cotton, maize, canola and potato. A GM rice
variety resistant to lepidopteron insects is also available.
The protein is called Bt toxin, since the protein originally came from a bacterium; Bacillus
thuringiensis. Different strains of this bacterium produce several different Bt toxins. Whenlarvae
feed on plant parts that express Bt toxins, they die due to the ingestion of the toxin.
Bt toxins are not harmful to mammals and are therefore considered safe for human consumption.
However Btmaize (Btcorn) is grown mostly for bio fuel and for animal feed. Since the toxin is
present in the plant tissues, the only insects that are killed are plant pests and therefore Bt crops
are also considered safe for beneficial insects. Figure 7.41 show some insect pests of com and
cotton. Bt toxins are natural products and therefore, are biodegradable.
However, the insects, when exposed to the same toxin over the time, develop resistance to that
toxin, rendering the GM crop useless. Several solutions to delay the resistance development in
insects have been proposed. Since the pollen grains containing the toxin can escape from the field
where Btcrop is planted, insects that are not feeding on the crop may also be killed by accidental
ingestion of such pollen. Therefore, Bt crops has a potential danger for non-target insects.

Plants Resistant to Diseases

A well known example of disease resistant crops developed by genetic engineering is the
availability of new varieties of papaya resistant to papaya virus (PRSV). This virus is
limiting the success of papaya cultivation worldwide. The same virus also attacks the cucurbits.
Squash with resistance to the virus has been successfully developed and cultivated.
Other examples for disease resistant crops are potato varieties resistant
to Potato Virus Y (PVY), Potato Leaf Roll Virus (PLRV) and late
blight disease. ringspot

Plants Resistant to Herbicides: The herbicide tolerant crops (HTCs) are developed in order to
be able to spray a broad-spectrum herbicide to control weeds when the crop has been established
in the field. When the crop is resistant to the herbicide that is sprayed, it can kill all the weeds
without harming the crop. The advantage in this is that the farmers can wait and see if the weeds
become a problem and can use herbicide only when it is necessary. This reduces the herbicide
usage. However if the same herbicide is used repeatedly, the weeds resistant to that particular
herbicide will develop. These are called superweeds. When a crop with resistance to one herbicide is planted after a GM crop with resistance to the same herbicide, leftover seeds of the previous crop may germinate and become a weed which cannot be controlled by the same herbicide.
In order to avoid these problems, rotation of crops with tolerance to different herbicides can be
practiced.
The best known examples of herbicide tolerant crops (HTCs) are crops modified to tolerate the
herbicide glyphosate. These plants are known as “Roundup Ready” crops because the commercial
name of glyphosate is Roundup.. The examples of commercially available Roundup Ready crops
are cotton, maize, canola, soybean, sugar beet and wheat.
Another type of popular herbicide tolerant crops are called “Liberty Link” and “In Vigor” and are
resistant to glufosinate. Examples of glufosinate resistant crops include cotton, maize, canola,
soybean, sugar beet and rice.
Cotton modified to tolerate Bromoxinol are called BXN Cotton.

GM Plants with other Important Traits.

Other agriculturally important traits include improving product quality.
One of the priorities in this area is to increase the nutritional value of crops.
•	GM canola varieties with increased triglyceride component and with increased phytase
enzyme to breakdown indigestible plant phytate to release phosphorus, GM potato with
reduced amylose and increased amylopectin content and soybean with increased oleic acid
content in the seed are commercially available.
•	 A rice variety named Golden rice with increased levels of provitamin A is an interesting
example of product quality enhancement. The commercially available variety is modified
with genes from Pantoea ananatis, a plant pathogenic bacterium containing a yellow
pigment.
•	Tomato with delayed fruit ripening to increase the flavour and reduce the rate of softening
is another interesting development in GM crops. The source of the gene is tomato itself. A
part of the gene is copied in reverse direction by changing the orientation of the promoter.

Applications in Medicine

Human insulin, vaccines and other therapeutics are being produced using GMOs. These
pharmaceuticals produced by GMO are cheaper, since mass production at low cost is possible
and are considered safer.
Producing human insulin by genetically engineered £. coli is the best known example of the use
of genetically modified organisms in producing pharmaceuticals. Insulin extracted from animals
had various side effects on diabetic patients. The cost of production was also very high due to
the limited amount of source to extract insulin. Since those insulins are not the same as human
insulin, they were less effective. Nowadays the entire insulin supply is from £.co/I genetically
engineered by inserting insulin gene from human. Therefore the bacteria derived insulin is
exactly the same as its original product.
Hepatitis B vaccine used today is a recombinant vaccine produced in yeast. Engineering plants
to produce vaccines in their edible parts is a concept being experimented. The idea is to express
an antigenic protein in the plant cells. When the edible part with the antigen (e.g. fruit) is
consumed by someone; the person will develop antibodies against the antigen, so that immunity
is developed against a particular disease. These are called edible vaccines, and if this becomes
successful, low cost, safe vaccines can be produced and the delivery of the vaccine would be
painless. Storage will also not be a main problem. Therefore these are more important in less
developed regions of the world.
GM mammalian cells grown in cell culture are used to extract factor VIII used to treat
hemophiliacs and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) used to treat heart attack and stroke
patients.
After the completion of human genome project, the causes for various genetic diseases are being
identified with ease and speed. When the cause is identified, how to correct the mistake in the
defective genes can also be worked out. The incorrect gene then can be replaced with the correct
one by gene technology. If the problem is the expression of a specific gene, this technology can
also influence the expression of that gene. This treatment is called gene therapy or human gene
transfer. The DNA is delivered to the target cells extracted from the patient by using a viral
vector or as naked DNA using various techniques. The cells with corrected gene are reintroduced
into the appropriate tissue of the patient. Although the concept of gene therapy has a long history
since 1972, only a few applications are available to date. 

A gene therapy to treat leukemia 1s the first of that type in the USA. Another example of gene
therapy is to replace the mutated beta-globin gene causing sickle cell anemia with the correct
gene. During this procedure, bone marrow derived hematopoietic stem cells are extracted from
the patient, the normal beta globin gene is inserted into these cells and return the modified cells
back into the patient. The corrected bone marrow stem cells will produce normal erythrocytes.
The concept of personalized medicine is being developed, which is based on genetic information
of the patient to treat or prevent diseases.
GM insects have been employed to control insect vector born disease. GM mosquitoes have
been engineered which do not allow entry of malaria parasite into the gut, therefore breaking the
life cycle of the parasite. Release of these mosquitoes into the wild would reduce incidence of
malaria. Another example is the making of GM male mosquitoes carrying a male sterile gene.
Mass release of these male sterile insects results in mating with females, but not producing
offspring. This technology is call ‘sterile insect technology’ (SIT). In field trials in Brazil, the
Aedes aegypti populations have reduced by 95% by the introduction of sterile GM males.

Applications in Industry

Use of GMOs in industry has made it possible to produce novel products with low cost while
minimizing environmental impacts. Industries based on organisms or their products run at ambient
temperatures and pressures, demanding less energy.
Apart from the booming pharmaceutical industry based on GMOs and GM crop industry, some
products originated from GMOs are produced industrially. Some enzymes for food processing
and detergents are products of GEMs. Chymosin (rennin or rennet) is the first approved enzyme
produced by GMO. This is used in cheese industry to coagulate milk to separate whey. Chymosin
has been obtained by extracting it from stomachs of slaughtered calves. Since the supply was
limited, the cost was high and it affected dairy industry. The chymosin gene from cattle has been
engineered in yeast cells and these recombinant yeasts are the source of chymosin today. The
price has gone down considerably and the product is purer and devoid of contaminants of animal
origin. Amyl maltase is another enzyme produced by a GM Bacillus sp. This enzyme modifies
starch to be used as an ingredient in dairy industry. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
118,Molecular Biology and Recombinant DNA Technology,Concerns of using GMOs,"The most significant risk factor in use of GMOs is their possible unintended effects. Since this
is a relatively new technology, public is reluctant to accept it readily. However the public also
accepts the unlimited potentials of the GMOs. The debate between pro-GMO and anti-GMO
groups, organizations and individuals is intensive. Some of the controversial issues about GMOs
are mentioned below.
Health Issues
1. Data of some experiments involving rats, mice and other animals showed some health
implications after feeding with genetically modified food such as potato, maize, tomato and
soybean. The reports include damage to various tissues such as stomach, liver and kidney
and even increase in deaths. However, many other scientists question the methodology
used in such experiments and they also claim that they could not reproduce the results.
Therefore, more independent research is needed to confirm or to reject such claims.
2. Allergy development due to consumption of GM food or inhaling pollen of GM crops is
discussed as another health issue. The integration of foreign DNA in the host cells may
change gene expression or cause mutations, leading to unpredictable products. Some of
them may be allergenic, toxic or even carcinogenic. However, concrete scientific research
findings are not available or the findings are doubtful. The technology is now developed so
that the insertion can be done at precise locations without disturbing other functions of the
host.
3. The possibility of horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistant genes used as marker gene
is also highlighted as a potential health issue. The GM foods contain such genes and are
ingested in large quantities by consumers. Although there a possibility, all organisms have
barriers to horizontal gene transfer and therefore, chance of horizontal gene transfer into
humans is very low. Horizontal gene transfer among bacteria is more probable, and hence
transfer of antibiotic resistance to pathogenic organisms may have some health related
issues. However, the antibiotics used in rDNA technology are not used in chemotherapy.
On the other hand, the humans as well as all other animals have been eating food of animal
or plant origin ever since they were evolved, but there is no evidence to show genes
transferred due to eating food. 

Environmental Issues

1. The development of insect tolerant crops may harm the non-target insect by accidentally
ingesting the toxin produced in the GM crops. The toxin may be dispersed in pollen and
deposit on non-crop plants which the insects feed on. An experiment has shown that
Monarch butterfly larvae feeding on milk weed leaves dusted with pollen from GM crops
die. However, proponents of GM argue that the amount of pollen dusted on the leaves is
very much higher than the amount that could be deposited naturally.
2. Cross pollination will transfer the transgene (the foreign gene) to other non-GM varieties of
the same crop as well as wild relatives of the crop. It can therefore, contaminate organic or
non-GM farming.
3. When Bt gene is transferred to wild plants, the insects feeding on them will die causing
environmental imbalances.
4. When the herbicide resistance genes are transferred to weeds, they cannot be controlled
using the same herbicide, and therefore become super weeds.
5. The spread of a foreign gene in naturally growing plants is called gene pollution.
6. Since the herbicide tolerant crops are resistant to a particular weedicide, farmers may tend to
over use this herbicide to keep their fields clean. If that is the case herbicide tolerant weeds
will develop by frequent exposure of the weeds to the same herbicide. It is however argued
that the farmers will not spend money just to have a clean field, and they can use a ""wait and
see approach"" in order to spray herbicides only when necessary rather than spraying as a
precaution. Rotation of crops with tolerance to different herbicides will avoid development
of such super weeds.
7. As GM crops are being accepted by farmers as well as consumers, the extent of land under
cultivation will be dominated by GM crops limited to very few varieties. When the crop
diversity is reduced to such a small number, the tolerance to environmental impacts become
very low and a single environmental event may wipe out entire crop fields, leading to food
scarcity.
8. Narrowing down of crop diversity will contribute to loss of genes from the crop gene pool.

Socio-economic Issues

1. The newly developed GM crop varieties will be owned by the developers and patented.
Therefore the farmers are compelled to purchase their seeds every year from giant seed
companies with a monopoly, spending a lot of money. Poor farmers may not be able afford
to buy the seeds, and therefore, there is a risk of widening the gap between the rich and the
poor farmers. 
2. There is a growing public concern whether it is ethically correct to patent crops and biological
resources including genes that are found in nature. Some crops and products that have been
developed traditionally and used by indigenous people have been patented under some
biotechnology companies.
3. The consumer has the right to decide whether he/ she purchases GM or non-GM food. To
secure this right, the regulatory agencies need to implement a system of labeling to indicate
clearly whether the product is GM or not and if it is GM, then what are the changes that
have been made. Labeling is mandatory in some countries. However products labeled non GM have often been found to be contaminated with GM when tested.
4. Biological resources of a country or region with high biodiversity and traditional knowledge
are taken away by biotechnology companies without any authorization by the countries and
people or without paying compensation for product development. This is called biopiracy.
5. The manipulation of the nature in making GMOs contradicts the beliefs of certain religions.
In order to address potential risks and hazards of GMO, GMF and associated processes, a thorough
testing and screening procedures have come into effect. As such the process of producing and
commercialization of GMO and GME are under strict control of several legislations and authorities
in order to safeguard the consumer, society and environment. Approval of some GMOs has taken
25 years from the creation to market (e.g. GM Atlantic Salmon which grow twice as faster than
non GM).
An example of an international agreement is Cartagena Protocol. Many countries also have their
own legislations, such as National Biosafety Framework of Sri Lanka. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
119,Molecular Biology and Recombinant DNA Technology,Biosafety,"Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety

(Students are not expected to memorize the dates)
Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity is an international
agreement signed on 15"" May, of 2000 in Montreal, Canada as a supplement to the Convention
on Biological Diversity (CBD) signed in 1992, at the Rio- Earth Summit and is effective from
1993. Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety came into effect from 11"" September, of 2003. It is called
Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety since it had been originally scheduled to sign in Cartagena
in Colombia. The provisions in CBD were not sufficient to cover many aspects in biodiversity
related to the GMOs. The number of signatories to the Cartagena Protocol has exceeded 100. This
includes Sri Lanka which gave formal consent to the protocol on 28"" April, of 2004. 

The aim of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety is to protect the biological diversity from the
potential risks caused by genetically modified organisms or living modified organisms (LMOs)
created as a result of modern biotechnology. CBD defined biotechnology as “any technology that
uses biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or
processes for specific use”. The Protocol is based on “precautionary principle’ of CBD so that
products of new biotechnologies should follow rigorous control measures to avoid any potential
risk to the environment or human health and is applied to transboundary movement, transit,
handling and use of LMOs that may have adverse effect on the conservation and sustainable use
of biological diversity. This also applies to risks to human health. The provisions of the Protocol
are intended to allow developing nations to balance public health against economic benefits.
Countries and states may take appropriate actions to limit entering of an LMO to their territory if
they feel that there is lack of scientific information to ensure that the LMO is safe on environment
or human health. The LMOs maybe intended to be introduced into the environment or to be used
as food or feed. The shipment should accompany with appropriate documentation which identify
the LMO and whom to contact for further information. Sufficient information should be supplied
by the importer or exporter to the importing party to arrive at an informed decision on accepting
or rejecting the LMO imports and how to handle them in a safe manner.
The Protocol established a ‘Biosafety Clearing House’ (BCH) to assist parties to implement the
protocol by facilitation exchange of scientific, technical environmental and legal information on
and experience with movement of LMOs.
Sri Lanka signed the Protocol in May, 2000 and it is in force in Sri Lanka from July, 2004.
Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources was identified as the responsible institution for
coordinating the activities related to the Protocol.

National Biosafety Framework of Sri Lanka

(Students are not expected to memorize the dates)
The drafting of the National Biosafety Framework of Sri Lanka (NBFSL) was completed in 2005
by Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (now Ministry of Mahaweli Development
and Environment, MoMDE). This is based on a precautionary approach in accordance with
Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety with the objective of ensuring that the risks likely to be caused
by modern biotechnology and its products will be minimized and biodiversity, human health
and environment will be protected in a maximum way regulating the transboundary movements
through formulation of relevant policies, regulations, technical guidelines and establishment of
management bodies and supervisory mechanisms.
National Biosafety Framework of Sri Lanka is the starting point for a permanent legislative
framework on Biosafety in Sri Lanka. Based on the NBFSL two policies have been formulated. 
National Biosafety, Policy 2005 is one of those. The policy on biosafety sets the overall framework
in which adequate safety measures will be developed and put into force to minimize possible risks
to human health and the environment while extracting maximum benefits from any potential that
modern biotechnology may offer.

A National Policy on “Access to Biological Resources, sustainable Use and Benefit
Sharing” has been formulated in 2013 by MoMDE with the goal of “ensuring conservation
and sustainable use of biological resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits
arising from them” in accordance with Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and the National
Biosafety Framework of Sri Lanka.
However these policies have not yet been enacted by law.
The Target 12 of the National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan for 2016-2022 of Biodiversity
Secretariat of the MoMDE states that “by 2022 biosafety is assured”. The actions to be taken in
this direction are
(1) strengthening policy on biosafety
(2) implementing biosafety master plan and formulate biosafety legislature
(3) strengthening risk assessment procedures for new technologies
(4) strengthening capacity for risk assessment
(5) developing and implementing legal instruments to protect native biodiversity and
indigenous crops from contamination from GMOs and
(6) enhancing Sri Lanka’s scientific capacity on biosafety. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
120,Environment Biology ,Environment Biology ,"What is environment? The environment is the complex of physical, chemical, and biotic factors
that act upon an organism or an ecological community and ultimately determine its form and survival
What is environmental biology?
Definition: A scientific study of the origins, functions, relationships, interactions, and natural
history of living populations, communities, species, and ecosystems in relation to dynamic
environmental processes.
In other words, Environmental biology is the study of different biological components of the environment and its relationship with each other and with the abiotic components.

Why learn Environmental Biology?
By learning of environmental biology will be able to understand the structure and the functions of the environment we live in. Specifically to:
• understand how biotic and abiotic components of the environment are linked and interact
with each other,
• recognize organizational levels of the environment,
• learn about major processes of an ecosystem,
• Recognize different components offer retrial and aquatic ecosystems
• Under stand how human activities are altering ecological systems and
• understand how natural changes in the environment (such as climate change, flooding,
erosion etc) affect species and habitats.

Organizational levels of the environment

Several levels of organization are recognized by environmental biologists.
Levels of organization include the individual/organism, population, community, ecosystem, and biosphere.

•	Individual/ Organism — The first level is an individual. An individual is any organism or
living thing. An organism has its own characters in physiology, evolution and behavior in
relation to environmental factors.
•	 Population —A Group of individuals of the same species, living in the same area and
producing fertile offspring through interbreeding.
•	Community — A collection of populations of different species living in the same area
interacting with each other.
•	Ecosystem —An ecosystem is a collection of communities as well as the abiotic factors with
which they interact.
•	Biosphere — includes the entire portion of Earth that is inhabited by life.","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
121,Environment Biology ,Major biotic and abiotic components in the environment,"All Organisms live in a complex environment that includes several components which are
categorized under two major groups:
•	Abiotic components — The nonliving components (physical and chemical factors) of
the environment such as water, air, light, temperature, nutrients, sunlight, soil. Abiotic
resources are usually obtained from the lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere. Abiotic
components limit the geographic range (distribution) and the abundance of species.
•	Biotic components — the living components of the ecosystem which include plants,
animals, fungi, bacteria and protists etc.
Structure and function of ecosystems:
The concept of “Niche” and “habitat”
To understand how an ecosystem work, one should first look into the concepts of “niche” and
“habitat.” 

Niche

A niche is the role that a particular organism plays in the ecosystem. Each organism plays a
particular role in its ecosystem. In other words, a niche is how an organism “makes its living.”
.This involves how the organism gets its energy, which usually has to do with what an organism
eats, and how the organism passes that energy through the ecosystem. An organism's niche also
includes how the organism interacts with other organisms, its role in recycling nutrients, tolerance
to environment conditions such as temperature, soil moisture, etc. Therefore niche of an organism
describes what it needs to live and what it does in a particular ecosystem.

Habitat

The habitat is the physical area where a species lives. Many environment factors are used
to describe a habitat. The average amount of sunlight received each day, the range of annual
temperatures, and average yearly (annual) rainfall describe a habitat. These and other abiotic
factors of the environment such as soil condition will determine the kind of traits an organism
must have in order to survive there. A habitat should not be confused with an ecosystem: the
habitat is the actual place of the ecosystem, whereas the ecosystem includes both the biotic and
abiotic factors of the habitat.

Interactions between abiotic and biotic components of the environment

There are different types of interactions in an ecosystem. They are:
•	Biotic-biotic interactions- e.g. competition, feeding relationships, symbiotic relationships
between individuals and species.
•	Biotic-abiotic interactions- e.g. water uptake of plants from soil
•	Abiotic-abiotic interactions-e.g. chemical reactions occurring in the soil.

Feeding relationships within an ecosystem develop food webs and food chains through which
energy is passed from one organism to another.

Energy transfer in an ecosystem

The main energy provider for the earth is the sun. Using sunlight the green plants produce their
own energy and store in tissues. The source of energy required by all living organisms is the
chemical energy of their food. Ultimately, chemical energy in any organism is obtained by the
conversion of the radiant energy of sun which are stored in tissues of plants and animals.

Trophic level:

The producers and consumers in ecosystem can be arranged into several feeding groups, each
known as trophic level (feeding level). In any ecosystem, producers represent the first trophic
level, herbivores represent the second trophic level, primary carnivores represent the third trophic
level and top carnivores represent other levels. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
122,Environment Biology ,Food chain,"A food chain is a linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass from one
trophic level to another trophic level of an ecosystem beginning with a primary producer. Let's
look at the parts of a typical food chain, starting from the bottom (the producers) and moving
upwards as primary consumers, secondary consumers and tertiary consumers.
primary producers
At the first trophic level of the food chain lie the primary producers. The primary producers are
autotrophs and are most often photosynthetic organisms such as plants, algae, or cyanobacteria.
These organisms convert light energy to chemical energy or in another words produce organic
matter. 
The organisms that consume (eat) the primary producers are called primary consumers. Primary
consumers are usually herbivores (plant-eaters), though they may be algae eaters or bacteria
eaters.
The organisms that consume the primary consumers are called secondary consumers. Secondary
consumers are generally carnivores (meat-eaters).
The organisms that consume the secondary consumers are called tertiary consumers. These are
carnivore-eating carnivores, such as Eagles or big fish species. 
Food web
In a natural ecosystem isolated food chains do not exists. The food chains are interconnected
with each other to form food webs. The food web is an interconnected feeding relationships in an
ecosystem, 

Energy loss along food chains

The flow of energy along a food chain is always unidirectional. At each trophic level in the food
chain, a considerable fraction (about 90 %) of the potential energy is lost as heat and respiration.
As a result, organisms in each trophic level pass on lesser energy (about 10 %) to the next trophic
level than they actually receive. This limits the number of trophic levels in any food chain to four
or five. The most ecologically efficient food chain is the shortest one. Longer the food chain the
lesser energy is available for top members. Because of this tapering off of available energy in the
food chain a pyramid is formed that is known as an ecological pyramid. Shorter food chain has
more energy available even at the highest trophic level than that of longer food chain.

Ecological pyramid:
The trophic structure of an ecosystem can be indicated by means of ecological pyramid. The
higher the steps in the ecological pyramid the lower will be the number of individuals and the
larger their size. 

The concept of ecological pyramid was developed by Charles Elton; these pyramids are also known as Eltonian pyramids. The pyramids are a graphical representation which depicts the number of organisms, biomass and productivity at each trophic level. All ecological pyramids
begin at the bottom with the primary producers and they proceed to various trophic levels such
as herbivores consume plants, carnivores prey on herbivores and so on. The highest level is at the
top of the food chain. There are three types of ecological pyramids:
•	Pyramid of energy
•	Pyramid of numbers
•	Pyramid of biomass
Pyramid of Energy
Pyramid of energy represents the amount of energy at different trophic levels. The pyramid
of energy or the energy pyramid describes the overall nature of the ecosystem. As there is
considerable loss of energy during the flow of energy from organism to other, the energy pyramid
always upright and vertical.
•	This pyramid shows the flow of energy at different trophic levels.
•	It depicts the energy is minimum as the highest trophic level and is maximum at the lowest
trophic level.
•	At each trophic level, there is successive loss of energy in the form of heat and respiration,
etc. 
Pyramid of Numbers

The pyramid of numbers depicts the relationship in terms of the number of producers, herbivores
and the carnivores at their successive trophic levels. In most cases there is a gradual decrease in the
number of individuals from the lower to the higher trophic levels. The number of individuals from
the lower to the higher trophic levels. The number pyramid varies from ecosystem to ecosystem. 

Pyramid of Biomass

The pyramid of biomass is more fundamental. In this pyramid there is a gradual decrease in the
biomass from the lower to the higher trophic levels. As the fresh weight of biomass contains a
larger amount of water, dry weight of the biomass represents the amount of energy available in
the form of organic matter of an organism. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
123,Environment Biology ,Cycling of materials in an ecosystem,"The materials available for living organisms in the ecosystem is limited. Therefore these materials
should be recycled. The material stock in the ecosystem is decreased when the organisms such as
animals, plants, etc utilize them. Therefore when the organism is died, they are decomposed by
decomposers. Thus those materials will be available for the organisms and absorb them into their
body, assimilate and the excess will be removed as waste materials to the environment.

What is a biome?
A biome is a large geographical area which is classified based on the predominant vegetation
adapted to that particular environment. The climate and geography of a region determines
what type of biome can exist in that region. Each biome consists of many ecosystems whose
communities have adapted to the small differences in climate, topography and soil conditions
within the biome. Major terrestrial biomes include tropical forest, savanna, desert, chaparral,
temperate grassland, temperate broad leaf forest, northern coniferous forest and tundra. 
1. Tropical forests
This biome is distributed close to the equator and extends to the sub equatorial areas. Therefore
both tropical rainforests and tropical dry forests are included.
The average annual rainfall in tropical rain forests is about 2000 -4000 mm and in tropical dry
forests it is about 1500- 2000 mm. Seasonal rainfall with a dry season of 6-7 months is prominent
in the dry forests and a fairly constant rainy season is prominent in the rainforests.
Tropical rainforests have an average temperature of 25 -29 °C, whereas in the tropical dry forests
it may reach up to 33 °C. 
In tropical rainforests an emergent layer, canopy and sub canopy layers are visible. These are
followed by an understory layer which consists of shrubs, and large herbaceous plants. The
forest floor consists of small herbaceous plants, mushrooms, and a thick layer of dried plant litter.
Therefore the vegetation is arranged in several vertical layers and stratification is observed.
Evergreens are prominent in tropical rain forests whereas in dry forests leaves of deciduous species
fall in the dry season. Epiphytes are common in this biome. However in dry forests they are
less common. Shrubs with thorns as well as succulent plants often occur in dry forests. Tropical
forests constitute the higher diversity of plants and animals out of all terrestrial biomes. It has
many mammal species and 5-30 million species of arthropods some of which have not been fully
described yet. Animals in this biome have adaptations to suit the environment.
Animals in the rainforests show year round activity. Camouflage is common among small
animals. Large animals may have markings in their bodies . Birds often migrate to other regions
during dry period.
Human involvement in agriculture and development related activities has led to destruction of
these forests. 

2. Savanna
Savanna is spread close to the equator and subequatorial areas.
The average annual rainfall in this biome is around 300-500 mm. A prolonged dry season of
approximately 8-9 months is prominent. The average temperature range is 24- 29 °C. However in
subequatorial areas seasonal variations may occur.
Savannas are characterized by a landscape that supports scattered trees in a tall grass cover.
During dry periods the dried grasses catch fire easily. Therefore grasses adapted to withstand drought, naturally grow in savannas. These grasses have a very good underground connectivity.
The few herbs found among grass cover contain small leaves to reduce transpiration and thorns
to be protected from herbivores.
Seasonal rains encourage a fresh growth of
grasses to compensate the loss of biomass due to consumption by herbivores. 
Many insects (mainly termites), lions, zebras ed)
are the common animals in this region. Many
animals have effective locomotion for long

distance migration and long range vision for Figure 8.9: A Savanna |
hunting. Human settlement from a very early time has been reported in these areas. Due to rearing
of cattle and hunting of animals by humans the population of mammals have been decreased.
Fires caused by human aid help to maintain the grass cover of this biome in one way but it may
also have a negative impact by suppressing the growth of trees.

3. Desert
Desert is a temperate or tropical biome, commonly occurring near 30° north and south latitudes
(e.g. Sahara), and in the center of continents (e.g. Gobi desert in north central Asia). The distribution
of this biome is determined by the non availability of water such as in areas with annual average
rainfall is less than 300 mm per year. The temperature varies seasonally and daily and exceeds 50
°C in hot deserts while in cold deserts it drops below -30° C.
Deserts have more bare lands. If the vegetation is found they are sparse and widely scattered.
Desert plants have several adaptations to withstand the high temperature and scarcity of water.
•	Succulent plant body (e.g. Cacti and Euphorbs)
•	 Most plants have C, pathway of photosysnthesis
•	 Deep roots in shrubs
•	Ability to tolerate heat and desiccation
•	Reduced surface area of leaves
•	Presence of spines/ thorns
•	Presence of toxins in leaves 
Nocturnal animal species are abundant in deserts. Water conservation is a prominent feature, with
some species surviving solely on water obtained during the breaking down of carbohydrates in
seeds. Animals include snakes, lizards, beetles, ants, scorpions, rodents and birds.
Compared to other biomes, desserts relatively escape from disturbances due to human activities
as these areas experience extreme temperatures and contain limited water.","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
124,Environment Biology ,Cycling of materials in an ecosystem,"4.Chaparral
Chaparral occurs in mid latitude coastal regions such as North America, Chilie, Spain, Southern
France and South Africa. Chaparral is best developed in Southern California.
Chaparrals receive an average annual rainfall of 300-500 mm. They experience rainy winters and
dry summer. The average temperature is between 10 to 12 °C but can reach up to 40 °C.
The Chaparral biome is typically composed of dwarf forests and shrubs, and interspersed
herbaceous vegetation which include grasses and herbs. Chaparral is highly prone to events of
catastrophic wildfire. Therefore plants show the some of the following adaptations;
•	Seed germination occurring only after a hot fire.
•	fire resistant roots.
•	Uses of food stored in the fire resistant roots for resprouting after a fire.
•	Quick re -sprouting of the mother plant enables usage of nutrients released by the fire.
•	Tough evergreen leaves in woody plants to survive in droughts,

Most of the native mammals in chaparrals are browsers. They include Deers and goats. Chaparrals
are rich in diversity of small mammals, and several species of amphibians, birds, reptiles and
insects.
These areas have been reduced and disturbed due to human settlement, urbanization and
agricultural conversions. Chaparral is vulnerable to fire caused by human activities.
5. Temperate grasslands
These grasslands occur under temperate climatic regimes that are intermediate to those that
support forest and desert. Grasslands in North America are called prairie (they are often called
steppe in Eurasia and called pampas in Argentina). 

Precipitation is highly seasonal with periodic drought. These grasslands have relatively dry
winters and wet summers. The average rainfall is 300 to 1000 mm per year.
During winter seasons the average temperature falls below -10 °C and in summer it is about
30°C.
Grasses are the dominant plant species in these grasslands. The prairie is often divided into three
types according to height of the dominant vegetation—tall-grass, mixed-grass, and short-grass.
The height of grasses vary from few centimeters to two meters in tall grass pairrie. Fire and
droughts are occurred in these grasslands but many plants growing in those areas have adaptations
to cope with fire.
Large grazers such as horses and many types of burrowing mammals (prairie dogs in North
America) are found in these areas.
The tall-grass prairie is now an endangered natural ecosystem, because it has been almost entirely
converted to agriculture and farmlands. 
6.Temperate broadleaf forest
Distribution of temperate broadleaf forests are at mid latitudes in the northern hemisphere. The
average annual precipitation is between 700 to2000 mm. Significant amount of precipitation is
received throughout the year in summer as rain and in winter as snow.
Average temperature during winter is zero while in summer it is up to 35 °C. Summer is hot and
humid and allow a favourable time to the growth of trees.
The dominant trees are mostly deciduous. A vertical layering (stratification) can be seen in
temperate broadleaf forests. They are closed canopy layer, one or two strata of understory trees,
shrub layer and herb layer. There are only few epiphytes can be found.
Many mammals can be seen and they hibernate during winter seasons while the birds species
migrate to are as where climate is warmer.

Many mammals can be seen and they hibernate during winter seasons while the birds species
migrate to areas where climate is warmer. 
Forests are disturbed due to logging, clearance for agriculture and for human settlements.
7. Northern coniferous forest
The largest biome on earth is the northern coniferous forest. It is extended as a broad band from
upper band of Arctic tundra.
Precipitation: Annual average precipitation 1s around 300- 700 mm and a periodic drought is also
common.
The temperature is -50° C in winter and 20 C° in summer.
The northern forest is dominated by coniferous trees. e.g. Fir, Pine, spruce are common tree
species.
Many conifers are conical in shape and this shape of trees prevents accumulation of snow,
thus preventing the breaking down of branches. They have needle like leaves that prevent high
transpiration.
The diversity of shrubs and herbs in these forests
is less than that of temperate broad leaf forests
because of the limitations in precipitation and
warm temperature.
Commonly found mammals are brown bears,
moose, and siberan tigers. During some period
of time dominant plants can be killed by sudden
attacks of insects.
These areas are not heavily populated by humans,

but logging is a severe threat. 
8. Tundra
This biome covers expansive areas of the arctic region, amounting 20% of earths land surface.
Alpine tundra occurs at high altitudes on mountains, while arctic tundra occurs at high latitudes.
Most tundras receive very small inputs of water as precipitation, but nevertheless their soil may
be moist or wet because there is little evaporation in such cold climates, and deep drainage may
be prevented by frozen soil.
The arctic tundra annually receive an average precipitation around 200 to 600 mm and the alpine
tundra receives > 1000 mm precipitation respectively.
During the winter time temperature falls below -30 °C and during the summer temperature it is
always less than 10 °C. 

Mostly herbaceous plants can be seen that includes different types of grasses and forbs. Shrubs,
mosses, lichens and trees also can be found in tundra. A layer of permafrost which is a permanently
frozen layer of soil can be seen. This permafrost layer restrict the growth of the roots of plants.
Large grazing mammals such as Caribou and reindeer (migratory), musk oxen (resident) and
predatory wolves, foxes, bears together with many species of migratory birds that nest during
summer can be seen in this biome.
This area is sparsely colonized by humans, but heavily used for extraction of minerals and oils. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
125,Environment Biology ,Ecosystems of Sri Lanka,"Sri Lanka is in the north-equatorial tropical zone. Therefore, it experiences a climate with high
rainfall and temperature which permits the country to be blessed with a wide array of terrestrial
and aquatic ecosystems. The ecosystems can be broadly classified into groups as follows.
1. Terrestrial eco systems. 
a.	Forests-Lowland rain forests, Dry monsoon forests, Montane forests, Thorn scrubs
b. Grasslands- Savanna, patana

2. Inland wetland ecosystems- Rivers and streams, Reservoirs, Marshes and swamps, villus

3. Ecosystems is with coastal areas- Lagoons and estuaries, Mangroves, Coral reefs, Sea
shore, Sand dunes, Sea grass beds, Salt marshes.
The distribution of major vegetation types may be considered as broadly linked to the local
climate (mainly rain fall and temperature), topography, and the edaphic (soil) conditions. A broad
classification of major ecosystems of Sri Lanka is given below.

Tropical wet low land rainforests:
The tropical wet lowland rainforests are found below 900 m elevation in the south western quarter
of the country. The mean annual temperature is about 28 °C, and the mean annual rainfalls varies
between 2000 mm- 5000 mm in different locations without any dry period. The humidity is very
high.
These forests are characterized by a tall canopy, sub canopy and a sparse shrub layer consisting
mostly of the saplings of canopy trees. Sometimes an emergent layer is also seen above the
canopy.

The vegetation is filled with a network of woody lianas that reach to the canopy layer.
A diverse population of epiphytic lichens, mosses, liverworts, ferns, orchids are found while
many fungi inhabit decaying woods and soil. High endemism of floral and faunal diversity can
be seen in these forests. E.g. Sinharaja, Nakiyadeniya and Kanneliya are some examples of wet
lowlands rainforests. These forests are disturbed due to expansion of tea cultivation, agriculture,
industrial and residential development.
Some tree species found in wet lowland rain forests are;
•	S: Hora, T: Ennai (Dipterocarpus zeylanicus)
•	S:Naa,T: Nagai (Mesua ferrea)
•	S: Hal, T:Kungiliyam pinai (Vateria copallifera)
Some animal species found in the wet lowland rainforests are Purple faced langur, Sri Lanka
slender loris, Golden wet zone palm civet. 

Tropical montane forests
They occur at elevation beyond 1500 m above mean sea level. The average temperature is about
16 °C and rainfall is about 2000 mm without any dry period. The humidity is high as lowland rain
forests. 
these forests are characterized by a short canopy of about 13 m, with a dense shrub layer. There are
trees with umbrella- shaped rounded crowns and twisted branches having leathery small leaves to
accommodate the strong winds that prevail in the montane zone. High density of epiphytes cover
the branches and stems of trees. Some plants found in these forests are;
•	S: Keena, T: Pongu (Callophyllum walkeri)
•	S: Walkurudu, T: Kaatu karuwa (Cinnamomum ovalifolium)
•	S: Gal weralu, E: wild olive (E/aeocarpus montanus)

Some animals that inhabit montane rainforests of Sri Lanka are Sri Lanka Yellow eared bulbul,
Sri Lanka highland Shrew, Sambar.
Montane forests are distributed in central hills including Knuckles range, Piduruthalagala,
Hakgala. Montane forests were greatly affected due to tea cultivation. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
126,Environment Biology ,Ecosystems of Sri Lanka,"Tropical dry mixed evergreen forests/Dry monsoon forests

These forests have mean annual temperature of about 29 °C and rainfall around 1000 mm-
1500 mm., most of which falls during the northeast monsoon periods. There is a marked dry spell
from May to August. Above forests are distributed in areas below 300m altitude. 

These forests are characterized by having sparse canopy, a sub canopy and a well-developed
shrub/herb layer. Some plant species naturally found in these forests are
© S: Weera T: Virai (Drypetes sepiaraia)
e S: Palu, T: Paalai (Manilkara hexandra)
e §S: Kaluwara, T: Karun-kaali (Diospyros ebenum)
Some of the canopy trees are deciduous during the dry spell of the year. These forests harbor the
largest elephant populations in Asia. The mammal fauna includes leopard, bear, deer. Most of
the forests are protected as National parks such as Yala National Park, Wilpattu National Park,
Wasgamuwa National Park, Maduru-Oya national park, Ritigala Strict Nature reserve and many
sanctuaries and forest reserves.
These forests are disturbed by ‘chena’ cultivation, human settlements, extraction of timber,
poaching etc. 

Tropical thorn scrubs

These are called “scrubs” than “forests” as large trees are sparse and the vegetation mainly
consists of thorny shrubs. They are found in arid lowlands. The mean annual temperature is
around 34 °C and rainfall is below 1000 mm with a longer dry period. 

The following plant species are commonly found;
•	Gini- andara , T:Vindattai (Dichrostachys cineria)
•	 S: Ranawara, T: Avaram poo (Cassia auriculata)
•	S: Heeressa, T: Pirandai (Cissus quadrangularis)

Due to the dry conditions many fauna species cannot be found. However, Deer, Leopard, elephants
can be seen in these areas. They are distributed near Hambantota, Yala, Mannar, Puttalam areas
and disturbed due to various development pressures. 

Savanna
Savannas have a thick grass cover and few scattered trees. These are common on hill slopes of
the dry or intermediate zone. The thin layer of soil on hill slopes cannot support the growth of
trees and the grass cover of savannas helps to bind soil particles and reduce erosion of soil.
Periodic fires are common to this ecosystem as the fried grass cover easily catch fire in dry period
of the year. They have trees with fire resistant species.
Some plant species found in Savanna are trees are;
•	S:Aralu, T: Kadukkay (Zerminalia chebula)
•	S: Nelli, T: Topu- nelli (PAyllanthus emblica)
•	S:bulu ,T: Adhan- koddai, tanti (Zerminalia bellirica) and have grass species such as
•	S: Mana, E: Citronella grass _, Vasanai pullu (T) (Cymbopogon nardus)
•	S: Iluk E: Cogon grass T:Tharpai pullu (Jmperata cylindrica)
Savannas are seen in Bibile, Monaragala, Mahiyanganaya, Wellawaya areas. These are disturbed
by periodic fires set by villagers for various reasons. 

Patana

There are two types of ‘Patana’ found in Sri Lanka; wet patana grassland and dry patana grassland
based on the rainfall pattern and soil of the site.
‘Wet Patana’ grasslands are found in areas above 1500 m from the sea level with mean annual
rainfall of over 2000 mm. Temperature ranges from 5°C to 18° C. Mist, fog and frost are common
in these areas and do not experience any dry period.
The grasses do not reach more than one meter height and are called tussock grasses which
include the Chrysopogon nodulibarbis and Arundinella villosa. The animals include a large
Sambar and Wild- boare populations and few leopards. Extensive “Wet Patana” are found only
in Horton plains.
Dry patana grasslands are found in altitudes between 500 m to 1500 m. They receive a rainfall about
1250 mm to 2000 mm with a definite dry period. Temperature ranges from 18° C to 24 °C. The
vegetation is made up of grasses that grow up to 1-2 m height such as Pangiri mana (Cymbopogon
nardus) and Themeda/ (Pini bara tana)/ Themeda tremula.
“Dry Patana” is common on hill tops in in Hantana, Gampola, Welimada, and Haputale 

Wetlands
Wetlands are simply habitats with permanent or temporary accumulation of water with associated
plant and animals. According to Ramsar Convention, wetlands are defined as areas of marsh, fen,
peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary with water that is static or
flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide
not exceed six metres. The wetlands of Sri Lanka, which fit into the Ramsar definition, can be
divided into three broad categories;
•	Inland fresh water wetlands (e.g. rivers, stream, marshes, swamp forests and villus)
•	Coastal wetlands (e.g. lagoons, estuaries, mangroves, sea grass beds, salt marshes and
coral reefs)
•	Man-made wetlands (e.g. tanks, reservoirs, rice fields and salterns)

Rivers and streams

Sri Lanka has an extensive network of rivers, which drains a total of 103 distinct natural river
basins. The river basins originating in the wet highlands are perennial, while many of those in dry
zone are seasonal. There is hardly any vegetation to be found in running water.

Coral reefs
Coral reefs are one of the naturel wonders of the world Coral reefs consist of calcareous structures
secreted by group o1’marine invertebrates. Coral reefs are famous for their spectacular beauty
They are considered as rain forests of these because other high productivity and high diversity
of organisms in habit them. Coral reefs can be seen in southern coast (Akurala to Tangalle)","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
127,Environment Biology ,Ecosystems of Sri Lanka,"Villus
Generally villus are the flood plains of the reservoirs. Villu grasslands possess a special link with
the wildlife in the area, especially elephants and bird populations. The vegetation is dominant
with grasses (members of Poaceae) and sedges (members of Cyperaceae). Villu grasslands are
located in areas such as Mahawelli flood plains, Wilpattu National park etc. 

Lagoons and Estuaries
Lagoons are coastal wetlands generally separated from these a by a sand barrier. Eg: Negambo and
Bundala lagoons. Estuaries are formed in places where rivers enter the sea and does not contain
a sand barrier separating it from seas (e.g. Maduganga/Benthota). The daily tidal fluctuation isa
characteristic of these places.

Mangroves

Mangrove ecosystem is an intertidal vegetation that covers fringes of the lagoons and estuaries.
They share characteristics usually of saline/brackish water, loose soil and anoxic conditions. The
vegetation is also exposed to intense sunlight.
Mangrove plants could be categorized into two groups; true mangroves that occur towards the
boundary between sea and land and mangrove associates that occur more to wards inland 


Reservoirs
There are no natural lakes in Sri Lanka, but there are numerous ancient irrigation tanks mainly
scattered in the lowland dry zone. Typical irrigation tanks include ‘Parakrama samudra’, “Kala
wewa’, ‘Minneriya wewa and tissawewa.
Aquatic plant species commonly found in the reservoirs are
•	S: Manel, E: Water lily (Nymphaea species),
•	e S:Nelum. T: Tamarai (Nelumbo nucifera)
•	e S: Kekatiya, T: Koddi (Aponogeton species).

Often free floating invasive alien plant species such as Sa/vinia and Japan jabara (S)/ water
hyacinth (E) also can be seen in these tanks. 
Sea shore

The long sea shore of Sri Lanka varies in nature. The most common sea shore type is sandy sea
shores. The sea shore areas share the characteristics of high temperature throughout, and salt
spray and high winds especially during the monsoon seasons. Most of the sea shore plants have
adapted to these conditions. Examples for these plants are Muhudu Binthamburu (S), Beach
Morning Glory (E)- atampu (T) (Jpomea pescaprae), Maha rawana revula (S), Ravannan meesai
(T)- Spinifex littoreus .
The vegetation gradually become stable a distance away from the tide mark, with the stabilization
of the soil. In these areas plant species such as wara (S)/ erukkalai (T)- (Ca/lotropis gigantea),
Wetakeiya (S)/ talai (T)- Pandanus species etc. can be found. 

Sand Dunes
Dunes are characterized by stunted or creping vegetation on large masses of sand. The
sand dune structure is determined by wind speed and direction. Dunes are raised beaches of
sand and are characteristic of certain coastal areas in the arid zone. Eg: near Mullativu,
Trincomalee,Kalpitiya, Yala etc. 

Salt marshes
These are marshlands restricted to the arid coastal regions of the country where soil dries up to
form crystals of salts during the dry season. Low rainfall, high wind, high temperatures and loose
sand blowing with salt are some of the major characteristics found in this ecosystem.
The vegetation has only few plant and animal species . Plants are short, contain fleshy succulent
plant bodies One common plant species is Salicornia species . Salt marshes are common in
Puttalam, Mannar, Hambantota and Vakarai areas. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
128,Environment Biology ,Biodiversity,"Definitions
Biodiversity includes all forms of “life” on earth.
Biodiversity is the variability among living organisms from all sources including terrestrial,
marine, and other aquatic ecosystems and their ecological interactions with the environment.
Biodiversity is explained under three levels. They are genetic diversity, species diversity and
ecosystem diversity. 

. Genetic diversity
The basic component of biological diversity is the genetic variation that exists both
within and among species. This genetic variation is the basis for evolution.
b. Species diversity
This is simply the variation that can be recognized among different species. It includes
the number of species (=species richness) and their abundance.
c. Ecosystem diversity is the variety of habitats, living communities and ecological processes in
the living world.
Ecosystem diversity is the largest cale of biodiversity, and with in each ecosystem, there isa great
deal of both species and genetic diversity in cooperated.
Ecosystem diversity on a global scale would be the variation in ecosystems in large regions(
biomes) such as deserts, forests, grasslands, wetlands and oceans whereas in smaller localized
regions it can be explained by means of different ecosystems.


The importance and values of biodiversity

The individual components of biodiversity—genes, species, and ecosystems provide the human
society with a wide array of goods and services. Genes, species, and ecosystems of direct, indirect,
or potential use to humanity are often referred to as “biological resources”. Genes are used by
plant breeders to develop new crop varieties. Many species are used as various foods, medicines,
fibers, fuels and industrial products. This include food resources like grains, vegetables, fruits
which are obtained from plant resources and meat, fish, egg, milk and milk products from animal
resources. The biodiversity products can be harvested and consumed directly without passing
through a formal market (non commercial goods). Example: fruits, fish, edible roots, leaves,
nuts, flowers, meat, animal product like milk and honey, timber, firewood, fiber, wool, wax, resin,
rubber, silk and decorative items, and traditional medicines, etc. Some products can be harvested
and available through a formal market (commercial goods). Many industries such as food, textile,
leather, silk, paper pulp are based on the direct use of biological resources. The ecosystems
provide many services to us, such as air and water purification, erosion prevention and flood
control.
Therefore the value of biodiversity is explained through its “goods” and “services” provided to
humanity and sustenance of the environment. 

•	Environmental service value: This is the most important services provided by biodiversity
in maintaining critical environmental functions, E.g. Carbon dioxide fixation through
photosynthesis, maintaining of essential nutrition cycles, maintaining water cycle and
recharging of ground water, soil formation and protection from erosion, regulating climate
by recycling moisture into the atmosphere, water purification, pollination, etc.
•	Recreational value: There is a great aesthetic value provided by biodiversity. Natural
landscapes at undisturbed places are a delight to watch and also provide opportunities for
recreational activities and hobbies such as bird watching, photography etc. Biodiversity
provides inspiration in artistic activities like poetry, painting, dance etc. It promotes ecotourism, helps to generate revenue by designing of zoological, botanical gardens, national
parks etc.
•	Ethical value: This is the right of all living beings to live on this planet, humans have
no right to decide which species should exist since we are just a small part of the greater
creation of nature.
•	Educational/Scientific value: knowledge about biodiversity helps in new scientific
discoveries and technological innovations to find solutions to the problems we face today.
E.g. learning of other animals like nematodes, rats and primates has helped in understanding
human body and development of medicines, knowledge about how animals react before a
natural disaster is helpful in disaster management, Interacting with biodiversity is proven to
be helpful in developing creativity, relieving stress and development of personality.
•	Social/Cultural/Religious values: Biodiversity can be important to different societies and
communities due to unique reasons E.g. Some wetland sites are sacred to Aborigines of
Australia, twenty eight species of trees are sacred for Buddhists, Bulls are considered to be
an important part of Hindu culture. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
129,Environment Biology ,Loss of biodiversity,"Animal and plant species die off all the time. It's how the biological world rolls. However, things
have changed dramatically in recent decades. According to some scientists, Earth is currently
in the midst of its sixth mass extinction. The last major extinction occurred some 65 million
years ago, when a large asteroid slammed off the coast of Mexico, killing off the dinosaurs and
most everything else. Today, scientists say the extinction rate is as much as 1,000 times faster
than what should be natural rate would be. This is solely because of the very high and negative
impact of humans on biodiversity due to high population and development. Virtually all of Earth's
ecosystems have been dramatically transformed through human actions, for example, many
mangrove and coral reef areas have been lost. Within groups of conifers, cycads, amphibians,
birds, and mammals up to 50% of species are threatened with extinction, according to the IUCN
Red List. Within many species groups, such as amphibians, African mammals, and birds in
agricultural lands, the majority of species have faced a decline in the size of their population, in
their geographical spread, or both.

Threats to biodiversity

Habitat loss/fragmentation: Humans supplant natural ecosystems to grow food, harvest
materials, and build our settlements. These actions alter or eliminate the conditions needed for
plants and animals to survive. When natural habitats are converted into other human uses such as
agriculture or built up area they are no longer able to support the species present in the original
habitat. This result in the displacement or destruction of biodiversity. E.g. deforestation, filling of
wetlands
Mass scale destruction of Mangrove in lagoons such as Negambo and Puttalam due to establishment
of prawn culture destructed the biodiversity of mangroves in these areas. When habitats are divided into fragments due to establishment of man built structures such as
roads, the animals and plant species are forced to occupy smaller area in a crowded manner which
is harder for biodiversity to sustain as in previous habitat conditions. 
Overexploitation: Harvesting or exploiting biodiversity products in a manner and a rate
which it cannot recover within the periods of exploitation leads to danger of biodiversity being
completely lost.
E.g. Over collection of indigenous medicinal plants from forests in Sri Lanka for export
such as Kotalahimbutu (S)/_ - (Salacia reticulata). Export of sea cucumber for medicinal
purposes from Sri Lankan shores. Ebony(E)/Kaluwara (S), Karun-kaali (T)- (Diospyrus
ebanum) is threatened due to over exploitation during the colonial period. Ebony has a very
slow growth rate and take many years to grow. Intense commercial fishing has led to over
fishing threatening decline of food fish like Tuna and Cod in world’s oceans.
Pollution: Pollution simply means addition of unwanted materials to air, water, soil. Due to
extensive use of agrochemicals that wash away with rain water into the water bodies make the
water rich in nutrients (eutrophication) resulting in algal blooms. Algal blooms create oxygen depleted zone in aquatic ecosystems and greatly reduce the populations of fish and other aquatic
species.
Uses of synthetic fertilizers for tea in montane areas also has resulted pollution of rivers in
many down stream areas affecting the water quality and making it unsuitable for human use
Releasing of Sulphur dioxide (SO,) and nitrous oxide (N,O) gasses react with water and make
the rain water acidic resulting acid rains. Acid rains caused by air pollution contributes to the
death of trees killing many buds, leaves and the seedlings and causing damage to the plant roots. 

Introduction of invasive alien species: Invasive alien species are alien (exotic) plants and/or
animals whose introduction and spread outside their natural geographic range threaten native
biodiversity. Alien invasive species compete against or prey on native species, which can lead
to their extinction. Once introduced , for a considerable period of time, they may lack natural 
predators in the new environment. This is a great opportunity for them to reproduces successfully
and spread without limits to take over the environment. They can transport disease, out-compete
native species, alter food chains, decrease biodiversity, and even change ecosystems properties
by altering soil composition or creating habitats that encourage wildfires. E.g. Alien invasive
species such as Lantana(E)/ Gandapana (S) / Nayunni (T)-(Lantana camara) does not allow
germination and seedling growth of many other plants as it produces toxins which are added
to soil through leaf litter. Extensive spread of Guinea grass(E)/ Gini- thana (S)/ Ginipullu (T)
(Panicum maximum) in especially in the dry pathana areas facilitates fire due to its dry biomass
during drought seasons. 
Climate change: Climate change is predicted to be the greatest long-term threat to biodiversity.
Increasing temperatures and temperature extremes, increasingly severe droughts, rising sea levels,
possible decrease in rainfall, regional flooding and reduced water availability change ecosystems.
Many species will not be able to adapt themselves fast enough to keep up with the coming changes
driving them to extinction or being endangered. Evidence suggests that the warming of the past
century already has resulted in marked ecological changes, such as changes in growing seasons of
crop species, distribution ranges, and patterns of seasonal breeding of animals.
Biodiversity hot spots-The areas with a high concentration of endemic species facing exceptional
levels of threats have been described by Myers in1988 as bio diversity hotspots. As a whole Sri
Lankahasa high degree of endemism. Sri Lanka(wet zone of Sri Lanka) together with Western
Ghats of India is considered as one of the Biodiversity hot spot in South Asian region.

to soil through leaf litter. Extensive spread of Guinea grass(E)/ Gini- thana (S)/ Ginipullu (T)
(Panicum maximum) in especially in the dry pathana areas facilitates fire due to its dry biomass
during drought seasons.

Climate change: Climate change is predicted to be the greatest long-term threat to biodiversity.
Increasing temperatures and temperature extremes, increasingly severe droughts, rising sea levels,
possible decrease in rainfall, regional flooding and reduced water availability change ecosystems.
Many species will not be able to adapt themselves fast enough to keep up with the coming changes
driving them to extinction or being endangered. Evidence suggests that the warming of the past
century already has resulted in marked ecological changes, such as changes in growing seasons of
crop species, distribution ranges, and patterns of seasonal breeding of animals.
Biodiversity hot spots- The areas with a high concentration of endemic species facing exceptional
levels of threats have been described by Myers in 1988 as biodiversity hotspots. As a whole Sri
Lanka has a high degree of endemism. Sri Lanka (wet zone of Sri Lanka) together with Western
Ghats of India is considered as one of the Biodiversity hot spot in South Asian region.","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
130,Environment Biology ,Extinction of species,"•	Existing species have to make room for new species either by changing themselves or
by becoming extinct. Therefore natural extinction has to be recognized as part of the
evolutionary process.
•	The rate of evolution has been generally higher than that of extinction. Therefor there has
been an increase in Biodiversity over time.
•	Extinction is the elimination of the last member of a species from the earth.
•	With the growth of human population and civilization, mankind has greatly increased the
rate of extinction.
•	The earth today is dominated by humans and no ecosystems on earth’s surface is free from
human influence.
•	In general it is estimated that about 5-10% of the species may face extinction within the
next 30 years.

Not only a species but also family or genus or a sub species (taxon ) can become extinct if
there had been a continuous pressure for its survival. The Red Data book published by the
International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN) provides a list of threatened species and
define extinct and threatened species as follows.

EXTINCT (EX)
A taxon is Extinct when there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual has died. E.g. Dodo
( Lived in Mauritius), Wooly Mammoth (Lived in North America), Legume (Crudia zeylanica) 
Extinct in the wild (EW): A taxon is extinct in the wild when it is known only to survive
in cultivation, in captivity or as a naturalized population (populations) well outside its natural
habitat. E.g.; Giant tortoise of Seychelles
Different categories of threatened organisms:
A species is said to be ‘threatened’ when it is about to leave the world. Threatened organisms
are described under three categories. Critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable. 

The red data book has indicated other categories such as nearly threatened, least concern etc , but
these are not considered as a * threatened species.
CRITICALLY ENDANGERED (CR)
A taxon is critically endangered when the best available evidence indicates that it is facing an
extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. Marbled rock frog (E)/Dumbara gal para diya
madiya (S) and Maha madu (S)/ Ratchatha madupunai (T)- can be listed as one example to
represent animals and plants critically endangered in Sri Lanka.

ENDANGERED (EN)
A taxon is endangered when the best available evidence indicates that it is facing a very high
risk of extinction in the wild. E.g.: Etha / Aliya (S)/ Yanai (T), Elephant (E), Wesak Orchid (S/E/T)

VULNERABLE (VU)
A taxon is vulnerable when the best available evidence indicates that it is facing a high risk of
extinction in the wild. Punchi Lena (S)/ Dusky-striped, jungle squirrel (E) and Buttercup (E)-
are among the vulnerable species found in Sri Lanka .
Endemic species:
An endemic species is a species that is confined to a particular area or country, and not found
growing naturally anywhere else in the world.
Two examples for plant species endemic to Sri Lanka are:
Dipterocarpus zeylanicus(S: Hora, T: Ennai)
Garcinia quaesita (S: Goraka, T: Gorakappuli)
Examples of two animal species endemic to Sri Lanka are;
Puntius nigrofasciatus (E: Black ruby barb, S: Bulathhapaya, T: Veddiyan)
Loris tardigradus (E: Slender loris, S:Unahapuluwa, T:Thevangu) 

Indigenous species: A plant or animal species that occurs in its historically known natural range
and that forms part of the natural biological diversity of a particular geographic area. 

Examples from Sri Lankan indigenous species are:

Lula(S)/ Snake head (E)/ Viral (T)
Kitul(S)/ Thippilipanai (T)
Exotic (alien) species: A species that has been introduced from another geographic region
to an area outside its natural range due to human activities, The introduction of species can
be intentional or accidental. The following examples represent examples for intentional and
direct introductions. Accidental introductions are indirect introductions often considered as
‘contaminations’ of direct introductions.
Tilapia (S/E), Japan meen (T) for inland fishery industry.
Rubber (S/E), Rupper (T) for plantation industry.


Migratory Species: Migration refers to the act of moving from one place to another in a manner
that is seasonally determined and predictable. Migration takes place so that organisms can avoid
unfavorable environmental conditions that limit breeding.

Figure 8. 36: Indian fly catcher
Relict species: The remnants of a once widespread species, which are now found in very restricted
or isolated areas, due to fact that areas in which these species are found is lost in many parts of
the world.

The Tuataraisan example which lives only on a few small is lands of New Zealand. -Ichthyophis
a primitive ancient legless amphibians with a worm like body. Lingula found in Tambalagamuwa
bay in Trincomalee is an example fora relict species in Sri Lanka.
Flagship species: Flagship species isa species chosen as a symbol or icon to represent an
ecosysteminneedforconservation.Thesespeciesarechosenfortheirvulnerability,attractiveness
or distinctiveness in order to bring about support and acknowledgement from the public at large.
Thus, the concept of a flagship species is that the publicity given to few key species, will help the
conservation of entire ecosystem and all species contained therein.
The Bengal tiger of India, the giant panda of China, Blue magpie of Sri Lankan-(Sri Lanka kehibella,
T: Neelavudalperumkuyil) are examples.

Keystone species: These are species that play very import an role in the stability and functioning
of a system. If that species is removed the system tends to collapse e g. Planktons of a pond
Invasive alien species-: Invasive alien species are alien (exotic) plants and/or animals whose
introduction and spread outside their natural geographic range threaten native biodiversity.
Invasive Alien species take the advantage of human disturbances in the environment to establish
and spread themselves. Their capability to tolerate wide range of environment conditions and
high reproductive output help them to easily and successfully expand their populations. Although
only a small percentage of alien species be come invasive they damage biodiversity (ecosystem,
species and genetic levels) in everywhere they invade and alter the services and ecosystem
values of the introduced environment. Therefore invasive alien species are considered as a
major cause for depletion of biodiversity and environment degradation. The following examples
represent invasive alien animal and plant species in Sri Lanka.

Kalutara Golubella (S)/ Giant African land snail (E) was introduced to Sri Lanka as a contamination
of soil brought with some other plants. The soil contained eggs of the snail. Japan jabara (S)/
Water Hyacinth (E)/ Kulavazhai (T) was introduced to the country in nearly 110 years ago as an
ornamental plant not knowing that it will become a serious invader afterwards.

Conservation

A principal goal of conservation is to ensure the long term survival of as many species as possible.
Species that are in danger of extinction have to be specially protected and steps should be taken to
ensure their continued reproduction and survival. Conservation can be done in two ways.
In-situ conservation: The species is protected and its reproduction facilitated in its natural
habitat. Basically a large enough population and adequate, appropriate, habitat space has to be
ensured. E.g. National parks such as Yala and Minneriya national parks, Forest reserves such as
Kanneliya, Piduruthalagala
Ex-situ conservation: The species is taken out of its natural habitats, and looked after in places
where its survival and reproduction are ensured.
Zoological gardens and Botanical gardens of a country play a key role in ex-sifu conservation. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
131,Environment Biology ,Global Warming and Climate Change,"Definition

Climate change refers to a significant, long-term changes of climate attributed directly or
indirectly to human activity, that alters the composition of the global atmosphere in addition to
natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods (United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change /UNFCCC, 2011). In the meantime, the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) defined the climate change as “a statistically significant change in
the state of the properties of the climate which persists for an extended period, typically decades
or longer"". This definitions refer to any change in climate over time, whether due to natural
variability or as a result of human activity. 

Global warming is the increase the average temperature of the Earth’s surface (atmospheric and
oceanic temperatures) due to enhanced greenhouse effect [or Greenhouse gasses, (GHG)].
Climate change includes warming and the effects arisen due to warming such as melting glaciers,
extremes of rains or more frequent drought etc. It can say in another way, global warming is one
symptom of much larger problem of climate change. 

Contributing factors on global warming and climate change
1. Increase of the emission of CO, and other greenhouse gasses (GHG) due to human activities
1.1 Carbon Dioxide (CO,) is produced by burning of organic matters and it is the most
common greenhouse gas to contribute to the global warming and climate change events.
Burning of fossil fuel (for running vehicles, electricity generation, industries etc.) is the
main cause of the emitting of CO, and burning of forests, solid waste are the other main
causes contributing the CO, emission.
1.2 Methane (CH,) is another greenhouse gas which has a higher global warming potential.
Main emitting sources are anaerobic decomposing (at manure management and waste
management), cattle farming, paddy cultivation and enteric fermentation. Even though
the CH, is a greenhouse gas with high global warming potential, it is less abundant in
the atmosphere compared to CO,,.
1.3 Nitrous oxide is (N,O) another greenhouse gas also with higher global warming potential
which is mainly released as by product of fertilizer production and use, other industrial
processes, the combustion of certain materials (biomass), nitric acid production, and
fossil fuel combustion in internal combustion engines. Nitrous oxide can remain very
long time in the atmosphere.
1.4 Manmade industrial gases, namely, Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), Hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs) and Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF,) are also considered as greenhouse gases with a
very high global warming potential.
1.5 Black carbon or the carbon particles which are suspended in lower atmosphere also
identified as another cause for global warming. Those particles released as a result of
the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, and other organic matters. These particles are
extremely small, ranging from 10 um 2.5 um. These Black Carbon have an enormous
ability to absorb heat and it cause to increase the air temperature. These particles have
ability to absorb heat than CO,,.
Carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO,), sulfur dioxide (SO,), tropospheric
(ground level) ozone (O,), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are also considered as gases
which have indirect radiative forcing effect. Water vapor, non-methane volatile organic
compounds (NMVOCs), and Aerosols are also considered as GHGs. 
2. Deforestation and decrease of the vegetation cover of the world
Deforestation is another main cause for global warming. At present the conversion of
tropical forest lands to commercial agricultural plantations like palm oil contributes to the
mass deforestation all over the world. Forests remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
and fix through photosynthesis (carbon sequestration). Deforestation reduce the carbon
sequestration capacity, carbon capture on the planet (i.e. soil carbon) and increase the
atmospheric CO, concentration.
3.Destroying the large quantity of phytoplankton by UV radiation due to the depletion of the ozone layer.
This is also similar to deforestation. Phytoplankton which live in warm seas are very
useful to maintain the Oxygen and carbon dioxide balance. Normally the carbon absorption
capacity of phytoplankton are higher than terrestrial plants. Though the phytoplankton are
unicellular microscopic organism they have been distributed in large area and they were
responsible for the 60%-70% of absorption of atmospheric carbon. Due to depletion of the
ozone layer UV radiation which comes from sun can destroy this kind of tiny organisms
and may cause to reduce the CO, absorption capacity of oceans and increase the global
temperature.

Effects of the global warming and climate change

1. Sea level rising
Scientists predict an increase in sea levels worldwide due to the melting of two massive
ice sheets in polar regions and thermal expansion of water. However, many island nations
around the world will experience the effects of sea level rise.
2. Extreme weather events
Occurrence of extreme weather events such as prolong drought, intensive rainfall and its
effects such as floods and landslides and storms have been increased for last decades was
considered as a negative impact of climate change. It causes loss, damages and disasters.
3.Less production of foods (Threat to food security)
Due to unexpected extreme weather condition the crop production will be getting loss
around the world. It may be due to heavy rains or the severe droughts.
4. Degradation of coral reefs
The corals bleaching and degradation due to rises in sea temperature is a severe danger
for whole ocean ecosystems and many other species which lives on coral reefs for their
survival. According to the recent reports coral populations will collapse by 2100 due to
increased temperatures and ocean acidification and its effects 

5. Increase the insect population.
Due to increase of the insect population some diseases such as mosquito-borne malaria and
dengue will spread than present. As well the over growth of the insect populations will be
a massive threat to food production
6. Loss of Biodiversity
Climate change and global warming may cause reduced biodiversity, Ecosystems structure
will be change and some species may move from their present range of occurrence and
may survive while some others will not be able to move and could become extinct.

Ozone Layer depletion

Most ozone particles are concentrated in the region of stratosphere in between 10-50 km of the
atmosphere, and this layer is identified as the ‘Ozone Layer’. This is very much important to
protect living things from burning from too much ultraviolet (UV) radiation emitting from the sun
Naturally, the total concentration of ozone in the stratosphere remains relatively constant with the
concentration of 300 to 350 Dobson Units (D.U). Ozone depletion is described when levels fall
below 200 D.U due to man-made ozone depleting chemicals (ODCs) as in the stratosphere over
the South Polar Region. This thinning of the ozone layer refers as Ozone hole.

Contribution factors for the Ozone layer depletion

Ozone depletion occurs when the natural balance between the production and destruction of
stratospheric ozone is disturbed or lost. This is mainly due to chlorine and bromine released from
man-made compounds called ozone depleting substance such as CFCs, MeBr, Helene and HCFC.

Effects of the Ozone Layer depletion

Depletion of the ozone layer in the stratosphere will increase penetration of solar UV-B radiation
which is likely to have profound impact on human health with potential risks of eye diseases, skin
cancer and infectious diseases.
It is a known fact that the physiological and developmental processes of plants are affected by
UV-B radiation.
UV-B radiation is likely to result in changes in species composition (mutation) thus altering
the bio-diversity in different ecosystems. It directly destroyed phytoplankton which form the
foundation of aquatic food webs in the sea and it cause to reduce the composition of food web in
the sea ecosystem. 

UV-B can also cause damage to early development stages of fish, shrimp, crab, amphibians and
other animals.

Desertification

Desertification means “process of land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas
resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities.”(Uncounted Nations convention to combat desertification, Paris, 1994),

Contribution factors for desertification
The main driving forces of desertification can be separated into climate variations and human
activities, according to the UNCCD definition. It is known that human activities have a great
influence in the climate change and it has caused desertification
Deforestation is another main factor to decertification because of it is directly influencing to
reduce the rainfall, precipitation, soil humidity and water recharge of underground reservoirs
Over-exploitation of water and soil, uncontrolled mining and excessive use of agro-chemical
products and as well as poor land management practices also caused to desertification.

Effects of the Desertification

Decrease ecosystems services and reduced biodiversity in affected areas. Decreasing of the
vegetation cover induce water scarcity, destroys habitats of animal and plant species and reduces
agricultural activities mainly the growth of crop species. It may effect to the food security of the
people as well as for the animals. The process of desertification presents a serious impact on
the human well-being and health of the people living in the areas affected by droughts and land
degradation
Due to the desertification carbon storage capacity of plants and soils will also be reduced in the
long run. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
132,Environment Biology ,Acid rains,"Acid rain is one of the most serious global environmental issue which, emerged due to air pollution
mainly due to Sulphur dioxide (SO,) and oxides of nitrogen. These pollutants are released from
anthropogenic activities such as combustion of solid waste, fossil fuels in thermal power plants
and vehicle engines.
Acid rain is a commonly used term for acid deposition, which includes rain, snow, fog and dry
particles that fall from the sky. Uncontaminated precipitation is also slightly acidic and normal a in water may be about a 5.6 on the pH scale because carbon dioxide is dissolved and carbonic
acid is formed. Acid rain may show a lesser pH.

Contributing Factors of Acid Rains

Mainly caused by the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere due to
burning of fossil fuels, where they are converted into sulfuric and nitric acid respectively.

Effects of the Acid Rains

Acid rain directly causes severe damage to building structures and marble statues
Increases the acidity of fresh water ecosystems such as streams, lakes, and marshes and it causes
to change the structure and the composition of above fresh water ecosystems.
Cause to destroy soil organisms and loss the soil fertility.
It cause to leach metals such as copper, aluminum, and some heavy metals such as lead and
mercury in the soil and into runoff as well as drinking water
Acid rain causes significant damage to forests. It directly affects trees and other small plants
which are important to the ecosystem

International agreements and key national legislations
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
(CITES)-1975
The aim of CITES is to ensure that international trade of specimens such as horns and skins
of wild animals and whole plant or parts of plants does not threaten their survival. According
to CITES, the export of some species ( as listed) requires prior permission and presentation of
an export permit. An export permit shall be granted only if export of that species will not be
detrimental to that species survival. Some examples from Sri Lanka are skin of Sri Lankan
Leopard (S: Kotiya, T: Siruththaipuli), plants of Cyeas - Madu (S) / Madupanai (T).
Conventions related to conservation of the environment
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)- 1992
The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), known informally as the Biodiversity Convention,
addresses all aspects of Biodiversity conservation.
It has three main goals:
•	The conservation of biological diversity (or biodiversity)- e.g. conservation of genetic
materials and species and ecosystems. 
•	The sustainable use of components of biological diversity- e.g. imposing limits to control
overexploitation.
•	The fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources- e.g. exchange of
genetic material, species between countries without conflict.

The Convention on Wetlands (Ramsar Convention)-1971
The Convention on Wetlands, called the Ramsar Convention, provides the framework for the
conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources. In Sri Lanka, there are six wetlands
declared as Ramsar sites: Anawilundawa, Bundala, Kumana, Maduganga, Vankalai and Wilpattu. 

international Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL)- 1973
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) is the main
international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by ships
from operational or accidental causes. The objective of this convention is to preserve the marine
environment in an attempt to completely eliminate pollution by oil and other harmful substances
and to minimize accidental spillage of such substances.
Montreal Protocol- 1989
Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is an international treaty designed
to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of numerous substances that are
responsible for ozone depletion. 

Kyoto Protocol-1977
The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement linked to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which commits its Parties by setting internationally
binding green house gases (GHGs) emission reduction targets. In 2012 Doha, Qatar, the ""Doha
Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol"" was adopted. During this commitment period (2013-2020)
parties are committed to reduce GHG emissions by at least 18 percent.
Basel Convention -1989
The Basel Convention on the Control of trans boundary movements of hazardous wastes and
their Disposal intends to protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects of
hazardous wastes. Its scope of application covers a wide range of wastes defined as “hazardous
wastes” based on their origin and/or composition and their characteristics, as well as two types
of wastes defined as “other wastes” such as waste containing heavy metals such as Lead (Pb) and
Mercury (Hg) and wastes from hospitals which contains contaminants.

Environmental Legislation and Policies in Sri Lanka

The Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka has provision for the
protection, preservation and improvement of the environment. The government of Sri Lanka has
formulated many legislation and policies focused on environmental conservation and most of
them are revised from time to time to accommodate updates. Legislation is a set of regulations
for which stakeholders is given a penalty when it is violated. Policy is a set of practices that is
followed by stakeholders and there is no such penalty imposed when it is not practiced.
Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance and National Environmental Act (NEA) are Some examples
for key legislation on environment conservation.

Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance (FFPO)

The Ordinance, No.2 of 1937, and subsequent amendments, make provisions for the protection of
wildlife and flora in the country. The authority responsible for enforcing this law is the Department
of Wildlife Conservation (DWLC). Operation and management of National Parks, Strict Natural
Reserves, Jungle Corridors and Sanctuaries are conducted under FFPO. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 7 & 8 ), Resource Book"
133,Microbiology,Nature of microorganisms,"Microbiology is the study of organisms that are too small and are not visible clearly to the
naked eye or un-aided eye when they exist individually. These organisms are referred to
as microorganisms. Microorganisms include bacteria, archaea, cyanobacteria/ Blue green
bacteria (BGB), fungi and protists. Mollicutes such as mycoplasmas and phytoplasmas,
viruses, viroids and prions are also studied under microbiology.

Microscopic nature of microorganisms
In general, microorganisms are less than 0.1 mm in size and cannot be observed with
unaided eye. Therefore, they must be observed with a microscope. Microorganisms and
their structural components are measured in micrometers and nanometers.
1 micrometer (um) = 10° m
1 nanometer (nm) = 10° m
Some microorganisms are more readily visible than other because of their larger size.

Ubiquitous nature of microorganisms:
Microorganisms are ubiquitous on earth. They are found in water, soil, air and interior and
exterior surfaces of other organisms. Marine and freshwater microorganisms form the basis
of food chain in oceans and freshwaters. Some of them do photosynthesis and are primary
producers in aquatic environments. Soil microorganisms help recycling of chemical
elements between soil, water, air and living organisms. Microorganisms suspended in air
as bioaerosols, have the opportunity to travel long distances with the wind current and
precipitate. Pathogenic bioaerosols, cause opportunities for disease spreading. Only a
minority of microorganisms that associate with other organisms such as plants, animals
and human are pathogenic. Majority of them are advantageous or harmless. However, all
viruses are harmful to the organisms they attached to. Some microorganisms are capable
of inhabiting extreme environmental conditions that are unfavorable or even lethal for
other organisms. Such microorganisms are known as extremophiles. Extremophiles
have been found inside the Earth’s crust, deep sea at high pressures, extreme acidic or
extreme basic conditions, hydrothermal vents, frozen sea water and anaerobic conditions.
Extremophiles are classified according to the conditions in which they grow. 

Types of extremophiles 

Extremophiles are microorganisms that thrive in extreme environmental conditions. There are various types of extremophiles, each adapted to specific extreme conditions. Thermophiles thrive in environments with high temperatures, such as hot springs and hydrothermal vents. On the other hand, psychrophiles are adapted to live in extremely low temperatures, often found in polar regions or deep-sea environments. Acidophiles can survive in highly acidic conditions, while alkaliphiles are able to live in environments with a basic or alkaline pH. Halophiles require high concentrations of sodium chloride (salt) for their growth, often inhabiting salt lakes or saline environments. Lastly, barophiles are microorganisms that thrive under high-pressure conditions, typically found in deep-sea environments. Many of these microorganisms can survive in environments that present more than one extreme condition, such as hot springs that are also acidic or deep-sea habitats that combine cold temperatures and high pressure.

Some of these extreme environments consist of more than one extreme condition. For
example,
- Many hot springs are acidic or alkaline in nature at the same time
- Deep seas are cold and remain in high pressure.
Microorganisms live in such environments are adapted to live with more than one extreme
condition. 

High growth rate of microorganisms:
Rates of growth and reproduction of microorganisms are high. Microorganisms possess
a high surface area/volume ratio due to their smaller size. This means that they have
large surface area available for exchange of materials from external environment. As a
result, flowing rate of materials in to the inside of cells and the exit of waste materials to
the outside of the cells increases and results in high metabolic rate. Therefore, average
generation time or the time required to double the population of microorganisms is
relatively less.

Morphological, nutritional, and physiological diversity of microorganisms:
Microorganisms possess diverse morphological forms. Bacteria possess diversity in their
shapes, basically three distinct shapes; rod shape/ bacillus, spherical shape/ coccus and
spiral shape/ spirillum. The coccus bacteria may arranged in different forms; coccus/
monococcus, diplococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus, tetrads and sarcinae. Bacillus
bacteria may arranged in to either diplobacillus or streptobacillus. Spiral bacteria may
arranged in to either vibrio or spirillum or spirochete.

Cyanobacteria exhibit a great variety of shapes and arrangements, unicellular to long
multi cellular filaments. Multi cellular Cyanobacteria may appear as either filamentous or
non-filamentous. Filamentous appear as chains and the non-filamentous appear as clusters
or colonies forming spherical, cubical, square or irregular shape. Two morphological
varieties are found in viruses based on their symmetry of protein coats; Icosahedral and
helical. In fungi, some of them are unicellular and others multicellular, consists of a mass
of fine tubular branching threads known as hyphae, collectively form mycelium. Hyphae
may be septate or aseptate. Prions are smaller proteinaceous particles. Unicellular protists
possess wide range of morphological diversity. Mollecutes are pleomorphic (variable
shapes).

Microorganisms show a diversity of nutritional types. Based on the sources of carbon and
energy, nutritional types of microbes are classified. There are forum a nondurational types
seen among microorganisms; chemoautotrophs, chemoheterotrophs, photoautotrophs and
photoheterotrophs.Basedontheutilization of oxygen, micro organ is ms can be classified in
to four physiological groups; obligate aerobes, obligate anaerobes, facultative anaerobes
and microaerophiles. Some microbes capable of fixing atmospheric molecular nitrogen,
show physiological diversity; free-living nitrogen fixing microbes and symbiotic nitrogen
fixing microbes.","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
134,Microbiology,Types of microorganisms,"1. Bacteria
Bacteria (singular, bactertum) are single-celled (unicellular) prokaryotic organisms. They
show different morphological forms and arrangements. The most obvious structural
feature of bacteria is the shape of individual cells. There are three basic shapes.
1. Spherical; coccus (plural- cocci)
2. Rod shape; bacillus (plural-bacilli)
3. Spiral shape; (plural- spirilli)
During cell division, cells can remain attached to each other and form different forms of
cell arrangements

Different forms of cell arrangement of coccus bacteria 
Coccus bacteria exhibit different forms of cell arrangements depending on their division patterns. When coccus bacteria divide in one plane and the cells detach after division, they remain as single, separate cells. In diplococcus arrangements, the cells divide in one plane but remain attached in pairs after division. Streptococcus bacteria also divide in one plane, but the cells stay connected in a chain-like formation.
In the case of tetrads, the cells divide in two planes, producing four cells that remain attached together in a square pattern. Sarcinae bacteria divide in three planes, resulting in groups of eight cells that stay attached. Finally, staphylococcus bacteria divide in multiple planes, forming grape-like clusters of cells. These various arrangements reflect the diverse ways in which coccus bacteria can organize after cell division.
Different forms of cell arrangement of bacillus bacteria 

Bacillus bacteria exhibit specific forms of cell arrangement due to their division across the short axis. In the single bacillus arrangement, the bacteria appear as individual rod-shaped cells. In diplobacillus, the cells remain attached in pairs after division. The streptobacillus arrangement occurs when bacilli form chains, where multiple rod-shaped cells remain connected after dividing. These cell arrangements reflect the simple but distinct ways bacillus bacteria organize following cell division.

Different forms of cell arrangement of spiral bacteria 

Vibrio bacteria have a characteristic curved rod shape, giving them a comma-like appearance. Spirillum bacteria possess a helical shape similar to a corkscrew, but with a rigid body. In contrast, spirochete bacteria also have a helical shape, but their body is flexible, allowing for more twisting and movement. These distinctive shapes contribute to their unique modes of locomotion and behavior in various environments.

Bacteria show a diversity of nutritional types. Four major nutritional types can be identified
among bacteria. They are classified based on the source of energy and carbon. 
Microorganisms can be classified into different nutritional types based on their sources of energy and carbon. Photoautotrophs derive energy from light and use carbon dioxide (inorganic carbon) as their carbon source, with examples including purple sulfur and green sulfur bacteria. Photoheterotrophs also utilize light as their energy source but rely on organic carbon for growth, such as purple non sulfur bacteria. Chemoautotrophs obtain energy from inorganic chemicals and use carbon dioxide as their carbon source, with examples like Nitrobacter, Nitrosomonas, and Thiobacillus thiooxidans. Finally, chemoheterotrophs derive both energy and carbon from organic chemicals, a category that includes most bacteria.

Some bacteria are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen. They show diversity in nitrogen fixation.
•	Free-living nitrogen fixing bacteria: Azotobacter sp.
•	Symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacteria: Rhizobium sp. with legume root

Mostly bacteria undergo asexual reproduction by binary fission, and in some occasion,
fragmentation or budding. In rare occasions, bacteria of two strains share a portion of genetic
material through the process of ‘conjugation’. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
135,Microbiology,Cyanobacteria,"Cyanobacteria are named for their characteristic blue-green (cyan) pigmentation. Cyanobacteria
also exhibit a great variety of shapes and cell arrangements, unicellular to colonial forms 
•	 Unicellular form- Cells separate after cell division. However, in nature majority of unicellular
forms stay together by copious secretion of mucilage by daughter cells.
•	Colonial form- Cells remain attached by walls or held in a common gelatinous matrix
forming a colony of cells. Colonies may either be non-filamentous or filamentous.
Non-filamentous colonial form- depending on the plane of division and direction there are
different arrangements such as spherical, cubical, square or irregular shape. Filamentous
colonial form is the result of cell division in a single plane and a single direction forming a
chain or thread like structure. 

Cyanobacteria are photoautotrophs that carryout oxygenic photosynthesis similar to plants and
algae. Many of cyanobacteria are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen. For examples, Nostoc sp.
is a free living nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria, Anabaena -Azolla symbiotically fix nitrogen with its
partner, 4zolla sp. (water fern). In most cases nitrogen fixation takes place in special cells called
heterocyst. Nitrogen fixation is catalyzed by the enzyme called nitrogenase in the heterocyst.
Nitrogenase is sensitive to oxygen. Heterocyst carry thick cell wall to protect nitrogenase from
oxygen that could diffuse from neighboring photosynthetic cells and from air or water.
Cyanobacteria carry another specialized cell type called akinete. They are thick walled resting
spores with stored food. Akinete Is resistant to drought and high temperature. Therefore, akinete is
able to survive during unfavorable environmental conditions although vegetative cells dries out.
Cyanobacteria reproduce only by asexual methods. Single unicellular and colonial non filamentous types undergo simple cell division while colonial filamentous and colonial unicellular
forms reproduce by fragmentation. 
Fungi (singular, fungus) are eukaryotes. They may be unicellular (yeast) or multicellular (molds).
Some multicellular fungi form mushrooms. Molds form visible masses called mycelia, which are
composed of long filament like structures called hyphae. Many molds contain cross-walls called
septa (singular, septum). Septa divide hyphae into distinct single nucleate cell-like units. Some
molds do not contain septa in their hyphae resulting in long continuous cells with many nuclei.
These are called coenocytic hyphae. The cottony growths sometimes found on bread and fruit are
mycelia of molds.

Fungi are chemoheterotrophs and acquire food by absorption. They possess saprophytic mode
of nutrition. They play important role in food chain by decomposing dead plant materials by
secreting enzymes and thereby recycle vital elements. Parasitic (plant and animal pathogens) and
mutualistic (lichens and mycorrhizae) modes of nutrition also found among fungi.
Unicellular fungi reproduce asexually by fission or budding, on the other hand, filamentous fungi
(molds) reproduce asexually and/or sexually by producing spores. 


Unicellular protists 

Unicellular Protists are pleomorphic, vary in their shapes and possess locomotive
structures such as pseudopods, cilia or flagella. They exist either individually or form
colonies. Some join together and form filaments.
Photoautotrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic modes of nutrition are found among
protists. 

There are aerobic, anaerobic and facultative anaerobic respiratory modes found among
protists.
Some algae contribute to the symbiotic interactions in lichens.
They reproduce sexually by gametes and asexually by fission. 


Mollicutes
Mollicutes are prokaryotes included in the domain bacteria. Mycoplasma and phytoplasma,
are considered unique due to absence of cell walls.
Mycoplasma and Phytoplasma
Mycoplasma are pleomorphic, vary in shape from spherical to filamentous. They are the
smallest prokaryotic group of organisms invisible under light microscope. Mycoplasma
do not contain flagella. Almost all mycoplasma are parasites of humans and animals.
Mycoplasma require high amount of organic growth factors. They reproduce by budding
and binary fission and do not produce spores. Mycoplasma are aerobic or facultative
anaerobic.
Phytoplasma resembles to mycoplasma in many ways. They are similar in size to
mycoplasma. Both can only be seen under electron microscope. Shape varies from
spherical to filamentous. Phytoplasma only infect plants and are generally present in
the phloem sap. They cannot grow in artificial media. They are transmitted mostly by
leafhoppers. Therefore, they reproduce in both leafhoppers as well as plant body. They
reproduce by budding and binary fission. They possess aerobic or facultative anaerobic
mode of respiration. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
136,Microbiology,Virus,"(a) Characteristic features
Viruses are neither prokaryotes nor eukaryotes and do not show any cellular organization.
They do not possess any metabolic activity or reproduction when they are out of living
host cells. Thus, they are not considered as living organisms. However, once they get in
to the host cells, they multiply and cause infection through various metabolic pathways,
shows characteristics of living organisms. Since viruses can only multiply within a living
host cell, they are obligate parasites. Viruses are very small can only be seen through an
electron microscope. Viruses possess simple structures, usually are composed of a central
core of a nucleic acid and surrounded by a protein coat called the capsid which is made
up of a fixed number of protein subunits called capsomeres. Viruses may have either DNA
or RNA as their genetic material. They do not have protein synthesis machinery such as
additional RNAs or enzymes for protein synthesis. Therefore, they depend on host cell’s
protein synthesis machinery. RNA viruses consist of reverse transcriptase enzymes for
reverse transcribing RNA in to DNA. 

(b) Morphology and types of viruses
On the basis of capsid architecture two basic morphological symmetries can be
identified (Figure 9.8).
1. Helical
2. Icosahedral
Based on the above symmetries viruses show four types of morphological forms; helical,
polyhedron, complex and enveloped.
I. Helical viruses- long rigid or flexible rods. e.g.; Rabies virus, Tobacco Mossaic Virus
Il. Polyhedral viruses- icosahedral symmetry present e.g.; Adeno virus
II. Complex viruses-Exhibits more than one form of symmetry with additional structures. e.g.;
bacteriophage
IV. Enveloped viruses. e.g.; roughly spherical. Capsid covered by envelopes. e.g.; Herpes simplex
virus. They can show either helical or icosahedral symmetry 

Multiplication of viruses
A single virus can give rise to thousands of similar viruses in a single host cell. Therefore, viruses
cause serious damages to their host leading to severe diseases in plants, animals and bacteria.
Bacteriophages are typical group of viruses that are capable of infecting bacteria. They multiply
by two distinct mechanisms; lytic cycle or lysogenic cycle.
Lytic cycle involves with the lysis of the host cell, whereas the lysogenic cycle allows viral DNA
incorporating into host DNA and multiply without causing lysis of the host cell.

Lytic cycle of a bacteriophage
There are five distinct steps in the lytic cycle ; attachment, penetration, biosynthesis, maturation
and release
•	Attachment: The first step is the attachment of virus to a matching receptor site on the
bacterial cell.
•	 Penetration: After attachment, bacteriophage injects its DNA into the bacterial cell. This is
facilitated by an enzyme which breaks down bacterial cell wall.
•	Biosynthesis: The next step is the biosynthesis of viral DNA and proteins in the host cytoplasm
using host resources. This stage induces degradation of host cell DNA.
•	Maturation and assembly: Once bacteriophage DNA and proteins are synthesized, DNA
and capsid are assembled to form complete virus particles. This is called maturation.
•	Release: Finally, bacteriophage induce bacterial cell to break open (lyse). Newly produced
bacteriophages are released from the host cell. These released bacteriophages can start another
lytic cycle in cells in the vicinity. 

Viroids

Viroids consist only of short piece of naked RNA with no protective layer such as a protein coat.
Viroids can only multiply within a living host cell using host cell resources. However, viroids do
not contain any gene and only carry signals for their multiplication. Viroids infect plants, but no
other life forms till to date.

Prions

Prions are proteinaceous infectious particles. Their size is smaller than virus. Although prions
lack nucleic acid they can replicate with the help of a host’s gene that encodes the prion protein.
They are found as disease causing agents in some birds and mammals. All these diseases are
neurological diseases. 

•	 Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs), because large vacuoles develop in the
brain giving sponge-like appearance.
•	Mad cow disease was one of the serious disease emerged in cattle in 1987.
•	Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is one of the human diseases caused by prions.
Human to human disease transmission has been associated with transfusion of infected blood and
tissue and organ transplantation. Some TSE infections may be transmitted from cow to human. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
137,Microbiology,Basic laboratory Techniques,"For the study of morphology and biochemical properties of microorganisms, it is essential to
culture them on artificial media. There are some basic laboratory techniques such as preparation
of artificial culture media and sterilization techniques, to be followed in culturing of the
microorganism of interest without any contamination. This section describes such basic laboratory
techniques.

Methods of sterilization

Sterilization is the process of removal or destruction of all forms of microbial life including
endospores.
There are two types of sterilization, physical and chemical.
I. Physical methods of sterilization
Sterilization by moist heat, dry heat, filtering using membrane filters, exposure to UV radiation
are some of the physical methods used in sterilization.
•	Moist heat sterilization
Here, moist heat is used to destroy the microorganisms present in the desired materials such
as culture media, temperature stable reagents/ fluids and various laboratory utensils. This is
done by denaturing of proteins by high temperature and pressure.
E.g. autoclaving- In an autoclave, steam with 121 °C temperature at the pressure of | atm/ 15
psi is used for sterilization. Extending the above condition for 15 minutes is sufficient to kill all
microorganisms (except prions) and their endospores.
Autoclaving is used to sterilize culture media, solutions, healthcare instruments and various other
items that can withstand high temperatures and pressure. Glassware can also be sterilized with an
autoclave if care is taken to ensure that the steam contacts all surfaces.

Pressure cooker also can be used for moist heat sterilization.
•	Dry heat sterilization
Here, dry heat is used to destroy the microorganisms present in the desired materials such as
glassware, Petri dishes, pipettes, inoculation loops, inoculation needles, scalpels, etc.

1. Direct flaming
It is a simple method of dry heat sterilization. This is used in laboratories to sterilize inoculating
loops, inoculating needles and scalpel blades by heating them on the flames of Bunsen burners
/ hot spirit lamp until they reach red hot.
2. Incineration
It is mostly done in an incineration oven at high temperatures. Incineration Is used to sterilize
hospital waste. Microorganisms are burned to ash during direct flaming and incineration.
3. Hot-air sterilization
Microorganism are killed by oxidation. Items to be sterilized are heated to about 170 °C
and maintain for 2 hours in a dry air oven. This type of sterilization is often used to sterilize
glassware such as Petri plates, flasks, beakers, bottles and pipettes.
•	Pasteurization
Louis Pasteur found spoilage of beer and wine can be prevented by applying mild heat that
kills organisms causing spoilage without seriously damaging the taste, texture and nutritional
content of the product. Later, the same principle was applied to milk products, now known
as pasteurized milk. The objectives of milk pasteurization are to eliminate pathogenic
microorganisms and reduce microbial number which prolongs milk quality under refrigeration.
High temperature short-time (HTST) pasteurization, which uses temperature of at least
72 °C for 15 seconds and low temperature long time (LTLT) 63 °C for 30 minutes are the
two main methods of pasteurization. Milk can also be sterilized by ultra-high-temperature
(UHT) pasteurization. Here, milk is heated to about 140 °C in less than 5 seconds by flashing
steam. This milk can be stored for several months without refrigeration.
•	Boiling
Boiling the materials such as surgical instruments to 100 °C. Most of the pathogenic
microorganisms are killed at boiling temperature.
•	Filtration- e.g. Membrane filters
Filtration is used to sterilize heat sensitive liquids such as solutions containing enzymes,
vitamins, antibiotics, vaccines and some culture media. Material to be sterilized is passed
through a filter by using vacuum. Filter retains microorganism and the liquid is passed through
the filter.
Membrane filters are widely used to sterilize heat sensitive solutions. Pores of membrane
filters are from 0.01 um to 0.45 pm size, retain almost all the microorganisms including
viruses and some large protein molecules.
•	UV Radiation
UV Radiation kills microorganisms that falls in to direct exposure, either through destruction
or damaging DNA. However, a major disadvantage of UV is that radiation does not penetrate
through solid surfaces and coverings such as paper, glass and textile. Therefore, anything to
be sterilized should have direct contact with radiation. UV radiation is commonly used to
sterilize air in hospital rooms such as operating theaters and nurseries. 

II. Chemical methods of sterilization
Few chemicals such as ethylene oxide and chlorine dioxide (both are gases) are currently used
as chemical sterilizing agents. Majority of chemical agents reduce microbial populations to a
safe levels or remove vegetative forms of pathogens.
Ethylene oxide kills microorganisms and endospores. It is also highly penetrating. Therefore
ethylene oxide is used to sterilize mattresses in hospitals.
Chlorine dioxide has been used to fumigate enclosed building areas contaminated with
endospores of Bacillus anthracis. It is most commonly used in water treatment prior to
chlorination.

Preparation of culture media

Microorganisms cannot be studied in their natural habitat such as in soil, water or air. Therefore,
we need to bring them to the laboratory and provide similar conditions for their growth and
reproduction. A nutrient material prepared for providing nutrition and anchorage essential to the
growth of microorganisms at laboratory condition is called a culture medium.
Not all microorganism can be grown on a laboratory culture media. They are called nonculturable microorganisms. Some microorganisms grow well on any culture medium whereas
other microorganisms require special medium.
Suppose we want to grow a culture of microorganisms present in a certain soil sample. The culture
medium should contain necessary nutrients, sufficient moisture and suitable pH. This medium
must initially be sterile which means it should not contain any living microorganisms. Therefore,
when preparing a culture medium all glassware and liquid nutrient solutions should be sterilized.
Nutrient agar (NA) and potato dextrose agar (PDA) are two general media, commonly used to
grow bacteria and fungi respectively. Nutrient agar is made up of peptone, meat extract, sodium
chloride, agar and distilled water. Whereas, PDA is made up of potato, glucose, agar and distilled
water.
Here, agar is used as a solidifying agent. Agar solidifies at temperatures below 40 °C which means
a culture medium containing agar is a solid medium. For growing microorganisms, solid culture
medium is usually contained in Petri dishes or test tubes.
Because most microorganisms appear almost colorless when viewed through a standard light
microscope, we have to prepare them for observations. One of the ways this can be done is by
staining, means coloring the microorganisms with a dye.

However, before the microorganisms stain, they must be fixed (attached) to the microscopic slide.
A simple stain is an aqueous or alcohol solution of a single basic dye. The primary purpose of a
simple stain is to highlight the entire microorganisms so that cellular shapes, cell arrangements
and basic structures are visible. Some of the simple stains commonly used in the laboratory are
methylene blue., crystal violet and safranin. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
138,Microbiology,Microorganisms and diseases,"Generally, humans are free of microorganisms at birth. However, during birth, the newborn first get
in contact with microorganisms present on the vagina of mother. Usually, these are Lactobacilli.
Lactobacilli colonize the intestine of the newborn. After birth, many other microbial populations
begin to establish inside or on the surface of the body. These are called normal microbiota of 


human body. However, internal tissues of healthy human body are free of microorganisms.
A part of these microorganisms colonize on the skin, and majority enter the body and colonize on
the inner surfaces such as mucous membranes of nose, throat, upper respiratory tract, intestinal
tract and genitourinary tract.
Anormal healthy body contains a large number of microorganisms. It has been estimated that the
human body consists of 1 x 10'* microbial cells for 1 x 10"" total body cells, which means a 10
times more microbial cells than human cells.
Majority of these organisms are generally harmless or even beneficial. For example, minimal
colonization of Escherichia coli at large intestine prevent colonization of pathogenic bacteria
such as Salmonella typhi. £. coli in large intestine synthesizes vitamin K and some of the B
vitamins that are absorbed into the bloodstream and used by body cells.
Recent interest in the importance of bacteria to human health has led to the study of probiotics.
Probiotics are live microbial cultures. e.g. Yoghurt exert a beneficial effect. Several studies have
shown that ingestion of certain lactic acid bacteria can alleviate diarrhea and prevent colonization
by Salmonella enterica during antibiotic therapy.
Although majority of human microbiota are harmless, some of them may change their interactions
with human body under certain conditions and cause infections. Those microorganisms are called
opportunistic pathogens. For example, £. coli is generally harmless as long as it remains in the
large intestine. However, they may cause diseases, if enter other body parts (urinary bladder urinary tract infection, lungs- pulmonary infection).

Terms related to infectious diseases
•	Pathogen: An organisms or entity (non-living entities such as virus and prions) that is capable
of causing disease
•	 Host: Organism within which infected pathogens live on or in and multiply.
•	Pathogenicity: The ability of a pathogen to cause disease in the host by overcoming the
defense of a host.
•	Parasite: An organism or entity living on or in another living organism (host) and obtain
nutrients and other resources from the host.

Characteristics of pathogenic microorganisms

•	Having optimal growth conditions (e.g. temperature) that corresponds to the body conditions
of the host.
•	Having structures to adhere to the host cells and protect against host’s defense mechanisms.
e.g. capsule, pili
•	Produce toxins; endotoxins or exotoxins.
•	Having enzymes for invasiveness such as phospholipase, lesithinase, and hyaluronidase.
•	Having enzymes such as DNase to alter the host’s metabolic processes. 

Virulence and virulent factors

Microbes express their pathogenicity by means of their virulence. Virulence is the degree of
pathogenicity of the pathogen. Some pathogens are highly virulent (chicken pox virus) whereas
others are less virulent/ non virulent.
Few genes of pathogenic microorganisms express factors which provide them the ability to infect
their host and cause disease. Such factors are called virulent factors.
The relationship between a host and a pathogen is dynamic, each modifies the activities and
functions of the other. As a result, outcome of such a relationship depends on the virulence of the
pathogen and the effectiveness of the host defense mechanisms.
Virulence factors enhance the pathogenicity and allows pathogen to invade and colonize host
tissues and disrupt normal body function. Pathogens use two major mechanisms for pathogenicity.

1. Invasiveness

It is the ability of pathogens to invade tissues by overcoming host’s defense mechanisms and
multiply for colonizing.
Several extracellular enzymes produced by pathogens contribute to invasiveness.
E.g.
•	Phospholipase- destroy animal cell membranes.
•	Lecithinase- Hydrolyzes the lecithin component of the lipid in the cell membrane.
•	Hyaluronidase- destroys the body tissue by breaking down the hyaluronic acid which is
cementing substance between cells.
Pathogenic microorganisms do enter passively through various portals or natural openings such
as wounds on skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal and genito-urinary tracts.

2. Toxigenecity
Ability of microorganisms to produce biochemical substances known as toxins that disrupt
the normal functions of cells. These are proteins or lipopolysaccharides that produce specific
harmful effects on the host, thus are called biological poisons. They may be,
•	 Endotoxins- Endotoxins are lipopolysaccharides. These are thermos-stable toxins which are
part of the microbial cell. Toxins are released when the bacteria die and the cell wall breaks
apart. All endotoxins cause the same signs of symptoms regardless of the species of pathogen.
These symptoms include chills, fever, weakness, generalized aches and sometimes shock and
death. Endotoxins are produced only by gram-negative bacteria
e.g. Lipopolysaccharides of the cell walls of Salmonella typhi
•	Exotoxins- Exotoxins are produced inside bacterial cells as part of their growth and metabolism
and are secreted or released to the surrounding environment after cell lysis. Exotoxins are
proteins. Majority of them are enzymes. Due to their catalytic nature even a small amount of
toxin is quite harmful. These are thermo-labile protein toxins, being inactivated by boiling.
Exotoxins are most commonly produced by gram-positive bacteria and a few gram negative
bacteria

Exotoxins are classified into three types
•	 Neurotoxins- interfere with normal transmission of nerve impulses. E.g., toxins produced
by Clostridium tetant
•	Enterotoxins- stimulates cells of the gastrointestinal tract in an abnormal way. E.g. Toxins
produced by Vibrio cholera
•	Cytotoxins- kills host cells by enzymatic attack. E.g. Toxins produced by Corynebacterium
diptheria ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
139,Microbiology,Important diseases of human caused by microorganisms and prevention,"Various diseases in humans are caused by microorganisms, encompassing a range of organ systems. Chickenpox is caused by the Herpesvirus varicella-zoster, while skin diseases such as Rubella and Measles are attributed to the Rubella virus and Measles virus, respectively. Eye infections like Conjunctivitis can be caused by Haemophilus influenzae or Adenoviruses. In the nervous system, Bacterial meningitis can be triggered by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Other nervous system diseases include Tetanus, caused by Clostridium tetani, and Rabies, caused by the Rabies virus. The cardiovascular system can be affected by Rheumatic fever, which is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. Tuberculosis is linked to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, while the digestive system is susceptible to Food poisoning from organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Salmonella typhi, as well as Cholera and Typhoid infections. In the respiratory system, Influenza is caused by the Influenza virus, and Pneumonia can be due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Hepatitis is linked to the Hepatitis A virus. The urinary system is affected by Leptospirosis, caused by Leptospira interrogans, while the reproductive system can see infections like Gonorrhea, caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Genital herpes, caused by the Herpes simplex virus. Finally, the immune system is compromised in cases of AIDS, caused by the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These diseases illustrate the diverse impact microorganisms have on human health across various body systems.

Avoidance and prevention of microbial diseases
Good hygienic practices in day to day life is the best method to avoid infectious diseases.
Antiseptics, disinfectants and immunization play import role in prevention of infection.

Methods of controlling microbial diseases of human

•	 Use of antiseptics and disinfectants

Antiseptics and disinfectants are chemical substances that are used to kill or reduce microbial
population in order to prevent infection. However, such chemicals are not effective against some
microorganisms. For example, polio virus, tuberculosis bacterium, spores of bacteria and fungi
are not destroyed by most antiseptics and disinfectants.
The major difference between antiseptics and disinfectants is that antiseptics can be safely and
directly applied to the human body, whereas disinfectants cannot. Therefore, antiseptics are used
in disinfection of living surfaces such as skin. Disinfectants are used in disinfection of non-living
surfaces such as operation theatres, bathing areas, sinks, kitchen tops, cutlery, drains etc.
Antiseptics and disinfectants are generally formulated as liquids. Their effectiveness varies with
concentration, duration of exposure, temperature and presence of organic matter.
Some examples of antiseptics and disinfectants are given below.
Antiseptics: ethanol, isopropanol, chloroxylenol
Disinfectants: phenol, hypochlorites (calctum hypochlorite and sodium hypochlorite),
•	 Use of Antibiotics in controlling microbial diseases
When the body’s defense fails to protect body from the infection or overcome the disease, it has
to be treated by chemotherapy with antimicrobial drugs. Antimicrobial drugs kill or interfere with
the growth of microorganism without damaging the host. Antibiotics are effective antimicrobial
drugs against bacteria.
Some antibiotics affect against a broad range of bacteria and they are termed as broad-spectrum
antibiotics, while others affect only against a specific group of bacteria and are called narrowspectrum antibiotics.

Antibiotics show various modes of action. Some examples are given below;
•	Inhibition of cell wall synthesis- Penicillin
•	 Inhibition of protein synthesis- Erythromycin, Tetracycline
•	Disrupting plasma membrane- Daptomycin
•	Inhibition of DNA/RNA synthesis- Rifampin 


•	 Immunization: Vaccines
A vaccine is a suspension of weakened pathogens or fractions of organisms that is used to induce
immunity. Vaccines are frequently used to control diseases caused by viruses because there is no
other control methods once infected. There are several types of vaccines.

1. Live attenuated vaccines
Vaccine contains live pathogens which were deliberately weakened for its pathogenicity.
These vaccines, mimic an actual infection. Since the pathogen is active inside the host, such
vaccines provide lifelong immunity. More often a booster (secondary) immunization is not
required. Examples for live attenuated vaccines are, vaccines for,
•	 Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR)
•	 Chickenpox

2. Inactivated vaccines
Pathogenic microorganism is inactivated or killed in the vaccine. Compared to live attenuated
vaccines, inactivated killed vaccines often require repeated booster doses. Examples for
inactivated vaccines are vaccines for,
•	 Virus diseases such as Rabies, Influenza, Polio
•	Bacterial diseases such as Cholera

3. Subunit vaccines
Subunit vaccines contain only the antigenic fragments of a pathogen that can induce immunity
in the recipient. Toxoid vaccines are the best examples for subunit vaccines, those have been
used for a long time. Toxoids contain inactivated toxins derived from a pathogen. Examples
for Toxoid vaccines are vaccines for Tetanus, Diphtheria, etc. Presently, subunit vaccines
are produced using genetic engineering. E.g. Hepatitis-B Vaccines. Subunit vaccines usually
require repeated booster dose to obtain full immunity. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
140,Microbiology,"Use of microorganisms in industry, agriculture and environment","Microorganisms have been exploited for various purposes long before their discovery. Babylonian
and Sumerian civilizations used yeast to make alcohol in as early as 6000 BC. After the discovery
of microorganisms, in the latter part of the nineteenth century, pure cultures of microorganisms
are being used in the food production. This increased the understanding of microorganisms, their
processes and products. At present various industries based on selected microorganisms and their
qualities are in operation.

1. Advantages of using microbial processes over chemical processes
- Simple nutritional requirements are sufficient for their growth.
- They are able to convert (metabolize) a wide range of raw materials.
- They are able to convert cheap raw materials into industrially important products.
- Due to higher growth rate, they can convert the raw materials into products within a short
period of time.
- Their growth conditions can be controlled to obtain desired end products 
- Reactions can be carried out at low temperatures, energy and pressures compared to the
conventional industrial methods.
They give higher yield with higher specificity when compared to the conventional industrial
methods.
Microbes are amendable to genetic manipulation to obtain desired yield and quality with high
efficiency.
Basic principles of metabolic processes of microorganisms for product formations
1. Microbial cells are used as the end products. e.g. single cell proteins
2. Microbial metabolic products are used as end products- they may be either primary end
products or secondary metabolites. e.g. primary end products- alcoholic beverages, secondary
metabolites- antibiotics.
3. Microbial metabolic processes are used as end products. e.g. bioremediation (heavy metal
remediation) , metal extraction (Cu, Fe ), retting (production of fibers).
4. Genetically modified microorganisms are used to produce end products. e.g. productions of
commercial enzymes (amylase from Aspergillus Niger), vaccines (hepatitis B), hormones
(insulin).
Applications of microorganisms in industries
Industrial microbiology is the large scale production of economically important products using
microorganisms and their metabolic processes. Recent technological and biotechnological
advances expanded the scope of industrial microbiology. Bacteria, fungi, algae and viruses are
used in industry.
In industrial microbiology, microorganisms can be considered as miniature chemical factories,
where various energy releasing (catabolic) and energy acquiring (anabolic) chemical reactions
take place. Within this factory, raw materials (substrates) are converted into end products, one
or more byproducts and wastes. End products can be separated from byproducts and wastes, by
purification to obtain a purified industrial products.
Commercial products made by microorganisms and their processes
1. Single cell proteins
- Microbial cells are grown in large scale as food supplement and rich in proteins are called
single cell proteins. e.g. Yeast, Spirulina sp. and Chlorella sp
2. Alcohol and alcoholic beverages
Microorganisms are involved in the production of almost all alcoholic beverages such as beer,
wine, sake, toddy and ethanol. Yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae ferment sugars into ethanol
and carbon dioxide 

globally, more than 70% of ethanol is produced by fermentation. Sucrose derived from sugarcane
is the most widely used fermentation substrate. In addition, simple sugars derived from plants and
dairy waste are also used
e.g. 1. Beer- by the fermentation of cereal grain malt.
2. Wine - produced by the fermentation of grapes or other suitable fruits.
3. Toddy - produced by the fermentation of sap of palms such as Palmyra and coconut.
4. Arrack- produced by fermentation of palm tree sap such as coconut and sugarcane.
3. Production of vinegar
There are two steps in vinegar production.
1. Alcoholic fermentation: sugars in malted grain, sap of palms, sugarcane and fruit juices is
fermented by S. cerevisiae. Ethanol is subjected to acetic acid fermentation.
2. Acetic acid fermentation: Ethanol derived from alcoholic fermentation undergoes incomplete
oxidation and is converted to acetic acid. This process is highly aerobic and involves
Acetobacter sp. and Gluconobacter sp.
Acetic acid bacteria

4. Dairy products
Dairy products are made by the fermentation of milk. Sugar lactose in milk is fermented by
lactic acid producing bacteria into lactic acid. These bacteria are killed during pasteurization,
therefore, added externally when making dairy products.
e.g.
* Curd and yoghurt is produced by fermentation of lactose sugar in milk by a mix population
of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis and S. thermophilus, L. bulgaricus add flavor
and Streptococcus spp. add creamy texture and flavor.
* Production of cheese- Streptococcus sp, Penicillium molds
* Lactic acid is commercially produced by using waste products from cheese and butter industry.
L. bulgaricus ferment lactose into lactic acid.

5. Organic acids
Majority of commercially produced organic acids are obtained through microbial fermentation.
Fermentation substrates such as beat or cane molasses and organisms such as Aspergillus
niger are used.
E.g. Citric acids- sucrose fermented by Aspergillus niger
6. Metal extraction
Some metals from ore are extracted with the help of microorganisms. This process is called
leaching. One of the best example is extraction of copper from lower grades of copper ore for
which other extraction methods are unprofitable. Thiobacillus ferrooxidans recover copper from the ore that contains iron and sulfur. About 70% of copper in the ore can be recovered
by this microbial process. Uranium, gold and cobalt ore are also leached in similar manner
using microbial processes.
7. Production of vitamins
Microbes can provide a source of an inexpensive source of vitamins for individual food
supplements. E.g. vitamin B/2 — Pseudomonas sp. and Propionibacterium sp
Riboflavin- fermentation by fungi
Vitamin C- Acetobacter sp
8. Vaccines
Commercial production of vaccine is done by variety of microbial antigens used in active
immunization against various diseases. Some of them are genetically engineered vaccines.
E.g. Hepatitis B vaccines.
Commercial production of various antibody preparation used for passive immunization.
E.g. anti toxins against tetanus, Botulism toxin and immunoglobulin against rabies.
9. Enzymes
A range of enzymes are commercially produced by microorganisms. For example,
•	 Amylase: Aspergillus niger, A. oryzae, Bacillus subtilis
•	 Protease: 4. oryzae
•	Lipase: Rhizopus spp.
•	Invertase: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
•	Cellulase: A. niger

10. Antibiotics
Antibiotics is the most important secondary metabolites of microorganisms. Many antibiotics are
still produced by microbial fermentation.
•	Tetracycline: S. awreofaciens
•	 Penicillin: Penicillium chrysene
•	Streptomycin: Streptomyces griseus

11. Hormones
a. Human insulin
Conventionally, insulin is extracted from animal pancreas. However, this is expensive
and often cannot meet the demand. At present, insulin is produced cheaply by using
genetically modified £. coli and S. cerevisiae. This insulin is identical to human insulin. 
b. Human growth hormone
Earlier animal-derived hormones were used as alternatives to human growth hormone, but
with very less efficiency. At present this hormone is successfully produced by genetically
engineered £. coli in large scale.
12. Retting
Retting is the process of loosening fibers from woody stem or other plant material such as
coir. For retting, plant materials are immersed in water for varying periods of time depending
on the plant material. Heterogeneous bacterial populations participate in the process under
aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Bacteria secrete enzymes, mainly pectinases to facilitate
loosening.
13. Biogas production
Anaerobic digestion of organic waste produces various gases, called biogas. The type of
biogas produced depends on the substrate biodegraded. Activity of acetogenic bacteria on
the organic waste produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen, whereas, activity of methanogenic
bacteria produce methane.
14. Biofuel production
Petroleum-based fuel supply is expensive and sometimes uncertain. Asa result, much attention
has been given to renewable replacement fuels such as ethanol, butanol, biodiesel and biogas
etc. In Brazil a large amount of ethanol is produced by microbial fermentation of sugarcane to
be used as a source of fuel. Also efforts have been made to produce ethanol and butanol from
cellulosic materials such as wood, wastepaper and cornstalks by using genetically modified
bacteria. Many researches are going on to produce biodiesel from microalgae.
15. Bakery products
Sugars in bread dough is fermented by S. cerevisiae, bakers’s yeast. The primary function of
fermentation in bread is to generate carbon dioxide. Bread dough is made with grain flour
such as wheat, rye and rice. Dough traps carbon dioxide and rises due to the pressure during
baking and form open crumb texture.","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
141,Microbiology,"Use of microorganisms in industry, agriculture and environment","Applications of microorganisms in environment management

Industries and agriculture release various chemicals substances that are not readily degradable in
nature. For example, plastic is a synthetic substance that is not biodegraded. Residues of pesticides
such as heavy metals, insecticide DDT, herbicide 2,4-D are some other examples of chemicals
that are not degraded or very slowly degraded by microorganisms and retain in the soil for long
periods and also contaminates groundwater.

1. Bioremediation
Bioremediation is a technology that applies of living organisms to remove, degrade or detoxify
pollutants. Bioremediation naturally occurs in the soil. In most occasions microorganisms are
used in bioremediation processes. Growth of microorganisms in polluted soils and water can be
stimulated to promote biodegradation/ bio-removal of pollutants. Microorganisms with selected
properties or genetically modified microorganisms with selected properties can be used to degrade/
remove a specific pollutant from the polluted sites. Bioremediation is currently used to, 
•	remediate soil and water contaminated with oil spills, toxic metal waste, hazardous
organic waste ete.
•	decompose wastewater from food processing and chemical plants.

2. Solid waste treatment
Accumulation of solid waste from house hold (garbage) possesses various environmental and
health issues. In waste treatment, waste is degraded by microorganisms either aerobically or
anaerobically. Composting, degrades waste aerobically. At the end, waste is converted to a
stable material like humus.
Mostly garbage are placed as large compacted landfills or piles, where conditions are mostly
anaerobic. In such situations, waste is degraded anaerobically using methanogenic bacteria.
Methane gas produced as a byproduct of the degradation process. It may be used to generate
electricity or as natural gas.

Applications of microorganisms in agriculture

Microorganisms have various applications in agriculture for improving yield, agronomic
characteristics such as improved nitrogen and phosphorus absorption, resistance to pest and
diseases and tolerance to drought etc.
1. Bio-fertilizers
Nitrogen and phosphorus are the most limiting nutrients in soil for plant growth and
development. Therefore, chemical fertilizers are applied to the soil, to improve bioavailability
of these nutrients. However, intensive use of synthetic fertilizers may result environmental
problems such as deprivation of soil and water quality. Hence, much attention has been given
for microorganisms that can be applied into the cropping systems to improve bioavailability
of N and P. These microbial inoculants are called bio -fertilizers.
a. Phosphate solubilizing bacteria and mycorrhizae:
Phosphorus is the most limiting nutrient among all major plant nutrients. Bioavailability of
phosphorus in any type of soil is negligible. (Very low amount of phosphorus applied to the
soil remain available for plants). Phosphate solubilizing bacteria and Mycorrhizae contributes
in improving the solubility of phosphorus in the soil solution. These bacteria and fungi secrete
organic acids that dissolve minerals containing phosphorus and chelate cationic partners of
the phosphate ions, thereby release phosphorus into the soil solution. At present, commercial
formulations of microbial bio-fertilizers are available in the market.
b. Nitrogen fixing microorganism:
Biological nitrogen fixation is a process, where microorganisms convert atmospheric
molecular nitrogen into its soluble form. These soluble forms of nitrogen can be assimilated
by some plants directly or converted into desired soluble forms of nitrogen. E.g.
•	 Symbiotic nitrogen fixing
o Rhizobium sp. form intimate relationships with leguminous plants. The fixed nitrogen 1s
released to the soil when plants die, making nitrogen available for other plants. Various
Rhizobium inoculations are commercially available.
o Nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, Anabaena sp. form symbiotic association with water fern
Azoilla. This system has been successfully used in rice cultivation in many countries 
•	 Free living nitrogen fixing
o Free living nitrogen fixing bacteria such as Azofobacter present in high concentrations at
rhizosphere.

c. Plant growth promoting bacteria
Many microorganisms in the plant rhizosphere produce plant growth-promoting substances like
auxins (indole-3-acitic acid), cytokinins. These bacteria include,
Pseudomonas putida, P. fluorescens: auxin
Azotobacter sp., Rhizobium sp., B. subtilis, P_ fluorescens: cytokinins
Acetobacter sp., Azospirillum sp: Gibberellin
(Names of the above microorganisms are not expected to be memorized by the students)
2. Bio-pesticides/ Bio Control Agents (BCA)
Extensive use of chemical pesticides leads to hazardous side effects to people. These
substances or their residues persist in food and the environment. The residual toxicity may
affect the non-target organisms. Further, over use of pesticides develop resistance against
pesticides among the pests.
Therefore, environmentally friendly and less toxic alternative strategies are required to replace
synthetic chemicals as pesticides. Naturally occurring microorganisms are being explored to
control pests and diseases. Some microbial formulations are currently commercially available
and widely used in many cropping systems. Those include, Entomopathogenic fungi, bacteria
and viruses
•	Entomopathogenic fungi: These fungi infect a broad range of insects leading to insect death.
They have been formulated into myco-insecticides.
•	Entomopathogenic bacteria: Bacillus thuringiensis: insecticidal and toxic for many insect
larvae. Protein crystals produced by this bacterium are toxic to larvae when ingested. This
toxin is called Bt toxin. After ingestion, toxin is dissolved and lyse tissues of the guts of
larvae. Majority of biopesticide formulations currently in use are Bt-based.

3. Composting
Composting is a process used to convert plant remains into the equivalent of natural humus by
microbial degradation. Degradation of organic matter by a mix population of microbes under
warm, moist and aerobic conditions.

Initial activity of thermophilic bacteria on the plant remains increase temperature of the pile
to 55-60 °C. As a result, thermophilic bacteria dominate in the degradation process for few
days. When temperature decreases over time, thermophilic microbial population is replaced
by mesophilic microbial populations. The process can be enhanced by addition of moisture
and supply of oxygen through turning the pile. In addition to bacteria, microbes such as
fungus, Actinomycetes and protozoa also contribute to the breakdown of organic matter into
compost. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
142,Microbiology,"Nature, distribution and role of soil microorganisms","Soil provides an adequate physical and chemical environment for growth of microorganisms
in terms of space and nutrients which include minerals, decomposing organic materials, water,
gases such as carbon dioxide, oxygen and nitrogen. Within a few centimeter depth of soil, there
are different amounts of oxygen, moisture, light and nutrition, increasing the diversity of soil
microorganisms.
The top few centimeters of the soil contains the largest community of bacteria. Microbial number
declines rapidly with increasing depth. Majority of soil microflora is represented by bacteria. In
addition, there are fungi, algae, protozoa and Actinomycetes. Actinomycetes, despite of being
a member of domain bacteria, usually it is mentioned separately due to their significances.
These microorganisms play a major role in decomposition of complex organic substances and
participate in cycling of elements in biogeochemical cycles. Elements are oxidized and reduced
by microorganisms for their metabolic requirements.
1. Mineralization
Mineralization is the decomposition of plant and animal residue by using extracellular enzymes of
bacteria and fungi. These enzymes break down complex organic materials into simple inorganic
materials such as CO, and H,O. This is the major process by which plant nutrients are made
available and recycling. Mineralization helps in following ways;
•	helps to remove plant and animal debris from the earth surface allowing other organisms
to live.
•	recycle minerals which are found in limited quantities on the earth.

2. Role of microorganisms in the carbon cycle
•	 All organisms contain a large amount of carbon in organic compounds such as cellulose,
starch, proteins and fat.
•	Photosynthesis is the important first step in carbon cycle, in which, the atmospheric
inorganic carbon dioxide is reduced/fixed to form organic compounds by photosynthetic
organisms. Photoautotrophs such as plants, cyanobacteria, algae and photosynthetic
bacteria fix carbon dioxide using energy from sunlight.
•	 Chemoheterotrophs such as animals and protozoa, depend on organic compounds
produced by autotrophs to utilize them as their carbon source.
•	Through food chain, carbon fixed from carbon dioxide by autotrophs, transferred from
organism at lower trophic levels to the organisms at higher trophic levels.
•	Both autotrophs and chemoheterotrophs, release a part of their fixed carbon as carbon
dioxide to the atmosphere through respiration. This carbon dioxide is again made
available for autotrophs.
•	In chemoheterotrophs, undigested food is released to the environment as faeces which 1s
later decomposed by soil microorganisms. 
•	Rest of the carbon fixed in organisms, remain within them until they die. Once the
organisms are dead, these organic compounds are decomposed and carbon dioxide is
returned back to the atmosphere.
•	Microorganisms, mainly bacteria and fungi play a major role in organic matter
decomposition.
•	Microorganisms play another major role in carbon cycle in relation to methane gas- Ocean
sediments contain a large amount of methane. However, about 80% of methane generated
within ocean is consumed by microorganisms called methanotrophs before it reaches to
the atmosphere.
•	Despite of the above, methanogenic bacteria in the ocean’s depths are constantly producing
more methane. 

3. Role of microorganisms in the nitrogen cycle
All organisms require nitrogen to synthesize protein, nucleic acid and other nitrogen containing compounds. About 80% of molecular nitrogen available in the atmosphere. This 1s
not biologically available for organisms. Therefore, it is essential to convert that atmospheric
molecular nitrogen into bioavailable forms of nitrogen. Certain groups of microorganisms are
able to fix gaseous molecular nitrogen into bioavailable forms of nitrogen such as ammonia,
nitrate and nitrite. Therefore, nitrogen available on the earth, organisms and the atmosphere
must follow cyclic paths.
There are four key steps in the nitrogen cycle, they are, ammonification, nitrification,
denitrification and nitrogen fixation.
•	 Ammonification
More than 90% of organic nitrogen in the soil exist as proteins. Proteins from dead plants and
animals are decomposed by extracellular proteolytic enzymes secreted by microorganisms
into amino acids. Resulting amino acids are taken into microbial cells and are then subjected
to ammonification in which, amino groups of amino acids are converted into ammonia
(NH,). In moist soil, ammonia is solubilized in water to form ammonium ions (NH,’). This
ammonium ions are utilized by plants and soil microorganisms. Ammonia in dry soil rapidly
disappear into the atmosphere.
•	Nitrification
Nitrification is the process of oxidation of nitrogen in the ammonium ion to produce nitrate.
This process is done by nitrifying bacteria living in soil in two stages.
In the first stage, microorganisms such as Nitrosomonas, oxidizes ammonium ions into
nitrites 
Plants utilize nitrate as their source of nitrogen. Therefore, microorganisms play essential roles in
providing nitrogen in bioavailable forms for plants and animals.
•	 Denitrification
In the absence of atmospheric oxygen, some microorganism use nitrate and reduces it into
N,. This process is called denitrification. Denitrification causes loss of nitrogen into the
atmosphere. Therefore, it reduces available nitrogen in the soil. Denitrification frequently
occurs in waterlogged soils, where limited oxygen is present. Pseudomonas sp converts
nitrate ions into molecular nitrogen through following steps; nitrate to nitrite, nitrite to nitrous
oxide and nitrous oxide to nitrogen gas

•	Nitrogen fixation
The process of conversion of nitrogen gas to ammonia is termed as nitrogen fixation. Bacteria
that are able to fix nitrogen require nitrogenase enzyme. Nitrogenase enzyme is inactivated by
oxygen. There are two types of nitrogen fixing microorganisms, free-living and symbiotic.
o Free-living nitrogen fixing bacteria- They are abundantly found in the rhizosphere.
Rhizosphere is the soil immediately surrounding plant root. e.g. Azotobacter sp. Many
cyanobacteria are also able to fix nitrogen. e.g. Nostoc. These organisms, exhibit
mechanisms to prevent the exposure of nitrogenase enzyme to the atmospheric oxygen;
Azotobacter sp - high rate of aerobic respiration, Cyanobacteria- heterocyst. Some
anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium sp also fixes nitrogen.
o Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing microorganism- They play an important role in agricultural
crops such as leguminous crops; soybean, beans, peas and peanuts. These symbiotic
nitrogen-fixing bacteria are commonly known as rhizobia. Leguminous plants are
specially adapted to facilitate symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Plants form root nodules
where, anaerobic conditions and nutrients for bacteria are given. Bacteria fixes nitrogen
and make it bio available to be used by the plant. Some non-leguminous plants can also
fix nitrogen symbiotically with different microbial combinations. Lichen, a combination
of fungus and an algae or cyanobacteria also fixes nitrogen. In rice paddy waters a small
free-floating fern, Azo//a fixes nitrogen symbiotically with Anabaena sp. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
143,Microbiology,Interactions of soil microorganisms relevant to plant growth,"Microorganisms in the soil directly interact with plants. Interactions in the soil such as rhizosphere,
mycorrhizae and endophytes with symbiotic relationship of bacteria, fungi and plant cells. These
microorganisms are beneficial to the plants in numerous ways such as nitrogen fixation, increased
uptake of water and nutrients such as phosphorous, secretion of plant hormones such as indole
acetic acid, increases iron uptake at iron limiting conditions and defense against pathogens. In
return plants provide organic compounds essential for the microorganisms.
Rhizosphere
This is a kind of symbiotic interaction between plant roots, and soil surrounding the root surface
for about few millimeters. This micro-ecological zone is called rhizosphere. Rhizosphere is
considered as the most biodiverse and dynamic habitat on earth.

Microorganisms in the rhizosphere feed on the compounds exuded by roots such as sugars, amino
acids and various aromatic compounds. Microorganisms compete —antagonize using antimicrobial
compounds with each other for resources such as nutrients, space, and water in the rhizosphere.
Bacteria are the most numerous organisms in the rhizosphere. Three most common genera of
bacteria inhabiting rhizosphere are Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Agrobacterium. Root exudates act
as chemical signals for bacteria to move towards the root surface. Both pathogenic and symbiotic
fungi associate with the rhizosphere.

Mycorrhizae

Mycorrhizae (myco = fungus, rhiza = root) are symbiotic association between plant roots with
fungi. All most all land plants have symbiotic association with one or more mycorrhizal fungi.
Mycorrhizal fungi extend the surface area over which nutrients and water can be taken up by the
plant. They can reach small pores in soil where plant roots cannot reach and uptake nutrients.
Most significantly, mycorrhizae increase uptake of immobile nutrients such as phosphorous, zinc
and copper. In return, mycorrhiza receive organic carbon from the plant.

Role of soil microorganisms in improving soil quality

Free living soil microorganisms and those associated with root surfaces, play a major role in
improving soil quality. Microorganisms are involved in the formation of stable soil-aggregates,
which are characteristics of good soil structure in fertile soils. Fungal filaments, Actinomycetes
filaments and polysaccharide gums/slimes produced by bacteria are involved in soil aggregation
formation. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
144,Microbiology,Microbiology of domestic water and waste water,"Contamination routes of drinking water

Drinking water resources can be contaminated with infectious disease causing organisms or
chemical pollutants. Since water undergoes a filtering of microorganisms when pass through
the soil into deeper layers, generally, water from springs and deep wells are of good quality in
microbial point of view. Drinking water can be contaminated by dangerous pathogens when feces
enter the water supply. Many diseases are disseminated by the fecal - oral route of transmission,
in which, pathogens are shed in human or animal feces, contaminate water, and ingested via
drinking. Examples for diseases spread by water (water-borne diseases) are typhoid fever, cholera,
diarrhea ete.
Contamination of drinking water by chemical pollutants is a global issue. Industry, domestic
and agriculture sectors release a large amount of chemicals that leach from the soil surface to
groundwater. Most of these chemicals are resistant to biodegradation. Most freshwaters, such as
tanks, often contain excessive amounts of nitrates and phosphates that come from agricultural
fertilizer and household chemicals such as detergents. Accumulation of excessive amounts of
such nutrients cause eutrophication, and flourish the growth of cyanobacteria and algae. They are
toxic to humans. This kind of dense growth of cyanobacteria and algae, is called algal blooms.
Various industries also release chemicals that are non-biodegradable. They too can contaminate
drinking water supplies.

Water supplies can be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms such as Sa/monella spp.,
Shigella sp. and Vibrio sp. that causes infectious diseases such as typhoid and Cholera. Therefore,
it is essential to detect the presence of such microorganisms before the consumption to prevent
disease outbreak.
However, it is not practical to test water samples to look for pathogens because, pathogens may
present only in small numbers and might not be included in the test sample. On the other hand,
since the testing for pathogens take time, discovery of pathogens in the laboratory takes time and,
it will be too late to prevent an outbreak of the disease. Therefore, it is important to test water
samples routinely for ""indicator organisms, which will indicate potential contamination of water
supply by pathogens.
One of the major criteria for an indicator organism Is that it should be consistently present in human
feces in large numbers. This ensures the, presence of indicator organism providing evidence for
contamination of water supply with human feces.
Sri Lanka, and many other countries use coliform bacteria as an indicator organism to test drinking
water quality. Coliforms are aerobic or facultative anaerobic, gram-negative, non-endospore
forming, rod shaped bacteria that ferment lactose to form gas within 48 hours in a lactose broth
medium at 35 °C. Coliforms constitute a large portion of human intestinal microflora. They are
nonpathogenic line in the intestine. Therefore, presence of coliforms in water indicates fecal
contamination. However, there are some coliforms found in plant and soil samples. There are
specialized test to distinguish coliforms that has fecal origin from coliforms present in plant and
soil samples. Coliform test is routinely carried out by laboratories of the national water supply and
drainage board to determine water quality of drinking water.
Water-borne diseases
Pathogenic organisms that are frequently transmitted through water cause infections in the
intestinal tract such as typhoid, paratyphoid, cholera, gastroenteritis and dysentery.
Process of drinking water treatment
Drinking water that comes from various water supplies can be polluted at any time. Therefore,
water needs to be purified before consumption for our health and safety. The idea of water
purification is not to sterilize water, but to make water free of disease-causing organisms. There
are three main steps in an urban water treatment plant. They are,
•	 Sedimentation and coagulation,
•	Filtration
•	Disinfection.

I. Sedimentation and Coagulation
This is the first step. If water is turbid (cloudy), water is allowed to stand in a holding tank for
a period of time to allow settling down of particles suspended in water. This occurs in large
reservoirs, where water remains for a holding period during which large particulate matter
settles to the bottom. Sedimentation is enhanced by adding alum (Aluminum potassium
sulphate) which produces a sticky precipitate. Many microorganisms as well as finely
suspended matter are removed in this manner.

II. Filtration
After sedimentation and coagulation, water is filtered by passing through beds of fine sand.
Filtration removes protozoan cysts and other microorganism. Microorganisms are trapped by
surface absorption onto the sand particles. This removes about 99% of bacteria. Some urban
treatment plants additionally use activated carbon for the removal of toxic chemicals.
IIL. Disinfection
The final step in water treatment is disinfection. Water can be disinfected by several methods.
Chlorination is one of the most commonly used methods. It kills pathogenic bacteria.
Disinfection by ozone (O,) is another method. Ozone is highly reactive. It kills microorganisms
by oxidation. Ozone has become a preferred method of disinfection since it leaves no taste or
odor and has little residual effect. 

Aste water (sewage) management
Wastewater includes water from household use such as water used for toilets and washing, water
from urban drainage systems and from industry. Many developing countries and some developed
counties still do not have proper wastewater treatment mechanisms.
•	 Principles and main steps in purification of industrial waste water
I. Primary treatment- Following steps are involved in the primary treatment.
•	   Large floating materials are screened out
•	Removal of sand
•	Removal of oil and grease
•	Solid matter settles out in sedimentation tanks
•	Sludge collected and removed
•	No biological activity is used here
•	Primary treatment removes 25-35% organic matter

II. Secondary treatment- Following steps are involved in the Secondary treatment.
•	 The liquid flowing out of primary treatment, enters the secondary treatment stage.
•	During this treatment, waste water is aerated to facilitate the growth of aerobic
bacteria and rapid microbial oxidation. One of two systems used are, activated sludge
and trickling filter.
•	Inactivated sludge, vigorous aeration is done mechanically. In trickling filters, waste
water is slowly sprinkled or sprayed over a bed of rocky material and allowed to
trickle. In this process, microorganisms grow on the filter bed and oxidize organic
matter.
•	In secondary treatment 75-95 % of organic material is oxidized.
o	The liquid flowing through these systems are then disinfected and allowed to flow
into natural waters. 
o	Sludge remaining from both treatments is sent to an anaerobic sludge digester where
anaerobic decomposition convert the organic material in the sludge, finally to methane
and CO, (biogas).
o	Digested sludge can be used as fertilizer.

Adverse effects of discharging large amount of waste water into natural water bodies.
•	Dissemination of pathogenic microorganisms
•	 Water pollution due to accumulation of biodegradable material and their decomposition
products
•	Decomposition which may consume large amounts of oxygen in water affecting aquatic
organisms (high BOD — biological oxygen demand)
•	Anaerobic decomposition leading to bad smells ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
145,Microbiology,Solid waste treatments,"Nature of solid wastes

Solid waste include materials such as plant and animal residues, food waste, paper, plastic,
polythene and glass. Among these, organic wastes such as plant and animal residues and food
wastes are rapidly degradable. However, synthetic materials such as plastic and polythene are
not easily degraded and tend to accumulate continuously. Proper management of solid waste,
ensure community health and environmental safety. Accumulation of unmanaged waste in big
piles in the open environment can lead to soil, air and water pollution which is harmful for the
environment and organisms in contact with the polluted environment.

Environmental and hygienic importance of recycling solid wastes
•	 Open dumping of waste provide breeding grounds for mosquitoes, flies, other insects
and rats. These organisms serve as vectors for dangerous diseases such as dengue, chikungunya,
various food borne diseases and leptospirosis.
•	 Contaminated water resources have the risk of spreading water borne diseases such as typhoid,
paratyphoid, cholera, dysentery and gastroenteritis.
•	 Piles of waste at public and residential area often create social issues due to unpleasant smell
generated during anaerobic digestion of waste.
•	 Heavy piles of waste sometimes can be dangerous due to accumulation of methane, generated
during anaerobic digestion of waste. Accumulation of methane can cause
explosion and fire.
•	Groundwater can be polluted by the leachate of waste piles. Leachate means liquid pass
through the waste, extracting the dissolved and the suspended matter from the waste.

Therefore, solid waste must be properly managed using appropriate technology which is socially
accepted and environment friendly. 

Methods of minimizing problems created by solid wastes (solid waste management)

1. Sorting and recycling
In many countries municipal solid waste is sorted into kitchen waste, plant material, paper,
plastic, glass etc. and collected into separate containers. Sorting allows separation of waste that
can be recycled such as paper, plastic and glass. Although paper is presumably biodegradable,
it is not easily degraded since microorganisms cannot effectively attack papers when the
waste is placed into large compacted dumping sites.
2. Degradation/ decomposition of organic matter
Readily degradable organic matter such as kitchen and garden waste is subjected to natural
microbial degradation by the process of composting. Resulting compost is used in agriculture
and gardening. Compost generate additional income to the waste management authorities
such as municipal council. Anaerobic condition in the pile of compost, promote the activity of
methanogenic bacteria. The methane gas they produce can be collected to generate electricity.
3. Sanitary land filling
Sanitary landfills are one of the most popular forms of waste disposal, primarily because, they
are the least expensive way to dispose the waste. More than four-fifths of municipal solid
waste is disposed in landfills. A sanitary landfill is an engineered means of disposal of waste.
In a sanitary landfill, waste is spread in layers on a piece of property, usually on marginal or
sub marginal land. The objective is to spread the layers and then compact them tightly, greatly
reducing the volume of the waste. The waste is then covered by soil. A landfill should not be
located in areas with high ground water levels. Much of the waste in a sanitary landfill will
decompose through biological and chemical processes that produce solid, liquid and gaseous
products.","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
146,Microbiology,"Microorganisms and food
","Why food is spoiled by microorganisms

All food materials used for human consumption are of plant or animal origin. Microorganisms
inhabit nearly every niche on earth, and food supply which are of plant or animal origin is no
exception. Food have a natural micro biota and also get contaminated with microorganisms in
nature during handling and processing. Food materials contain nutrients and water, act as culture
media for growth of microorganisms. The nutrients present in the food materials, the same that
is required for the growth of many microorganisms. Therefore, food serves as a culture medium
such as nutrient broth. Numerous bacteria, yeast and , molds will grow in this broth.

Physical, chemical and biological changes occur in food spoilage

Growth of microorganisms in food changes physical, chemical and biological structures of food
and making them unfit for consumption which is termed as food spoilage. Microorganisms
growing in food are heterotrophic bacteria and fungi. During this process, they breakdown
carbohydrates, proteins and fats, to obtain energy and other requirements for their own growth.
Various extra cellular enzymes such as amylase pectinase, cellulase, protease and lipase are
secreted by contaminant microorganisms, in order to complete the above process. As a result of
this, major constituents of food, undergo chemical, physical and biological changes. 


3. Presence and concentrations of gases in the environment- presence or absence of O, determine
the type of contaminants causing food spoilage. There are both aerobic as well as anaerobic
microbes cause food spoilage. 

Internal factors influence on food spoilage
Internal factors are those factors that are present in food itself.
1. pH- Most microorganisms grow best at pH values around 7.0 (6.6 — 7.5) and very few grow
below 4.0. In general, molds and yeasts can grow over a wide range of pH from very low
to very high (pH 2 - 10). Bacteria in general, grow between pH 5 — 7. Fruits such as limes,
orange and banana are likely to be spoiled by molds and yeast. Most animal foods such as
beef, chicken, fish, milk are susceptible to bacterial, mold and yeast spoilage.
2. moisture content- Drying is the oldest method of preserving food which is based on reducing
moisture content. High moisture containing food such as meat and fish are spoiled by bacteria.
Low moisture containing food such as biscuits and bread are spoiled by molds. Dried milk
powder or flour which contains very low moisture are not easily spoiled by bacteria or molds.
Salt and sugar containing foods (available water is low) are generally spoiled by halophillic
bacteria (salted foods), osmophilic and xerophillic molds/ yeast (sugary foods).
3. Nutrient content- Water, source of energy, nitrogen, vitamins and minerals are essential
nutrients for growth of microorganisms. Nutrient rich food are easily spoiled by
microorganisms. e.g.; Milk, meat
4. Biological structure- The natural covering of some foods protect the food from the entry and
the damage cause by the spoilage microorganisms. e.g., outer covering of fruits, shell of egg
Food borne pathogens of humans
•	 Typhoid - Salmonella typhi
•	Dysentery – Shigella
•	Cholera - Vibrio cholera
•	Food poisoning - Staphylococcus aureus
•	Botulism - Clostridium botulinum
•	Aflatoxin - Aspergillus flavus

Effects of food spoilage on human health

Some microorganisms produce various toxic substances in food, which cause food poisoning
or food intoxication when consumed. Illness may result from consuming food spoiled by
microorganisms. Microorganisms grow and multiply in food, increasing the numbers of microbial
cells, and also produce toxic chemical substances. Ingestion of large numbers of microbial cells
and their toxic chemicals by any individual through highly contaminated food, may develop
disease. These diseases/ illnesses are of two kinds;

(a) food borne infections- In food borne infections, the contaminating pathogenic microorganisms
enter the body of the individual consumed spoiled food, and inside the host, they grow,
multiply and also produce toxins which cause symptoms of the characteristic disease.
e.g. Salmonella typhi - typhoid fever
Shigella - dysentery
Vibrio cholerae - cholera
(b) Food intoxication- In food intoxication, the spoiled food contains toxins, produced due to
microbial growth. Any individual who consumes such contaminated food containing toxins
will develop symptoms of the disease, within a short period of time. e.g.;
•	Food poisoning - Staphylococcus aureus
•	Botulism - Clostridium botulinum
•	Aflatoxins - Produced by fungi Aspergillus flavus
In general all the above illnesses are referred to as due to food poisoning.
(c) Viruses also (entero viruses) cause some food borne illnesses. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
147,Applied Biology,Aquaculture,"Food and agriculture organization (FAO) defines aquaculture as the farming of aquatic organisms,
including fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants.
Importance of aquaculture
Farming edible aquatic organisms is accepted as one of the best solutions for feeding the ever
increasing human population. A healthy diet, high in protein is necessary to ensure that growing
population does not succumb to sicknesses and diseases due to lack of essential nutrients. Harvests
from wild sources of fish, crustaceans and other aquatic species cannot keep up with the demand
presented by the growing human population. Trying to match the demand through commercial
fishing would eventually result in over-fishing and the loss of those species entirely. It is accepted
that while aquaculture is essential to meet the human demand for fish and fishery products, it also
relieves the strain on wild species and allow them to continue to be a significant source of food
for humans.

General characteristics of species that could be cultured
•	Selected species should withstand the climate of the region in which it is cultured.
•	It should grow well (should have a fast growth) in prevailing physical and chemical
parameters of water in the area.
•	It should be easy to breed (breeding techniques should be available) so that sufficient
number of fertilized eggs/early fry could be obtained easily.
•	Techniques of incubation of fertilized eggs and rearing techniques of hatchlings/early
fry should be available so that the production of sufficient number of young organisms
(seed) would be easy under culture conditions.
•	If the eggs, larvae, fry, fingerlings, juveniles and adults of the species are hardy it is
easier for the hatchery manager/ farmer (handling hardy species is easy).
•	Food and feeding habits of each developmental stage of the species should be known
(easy to provide nutritionally balanced diet for each developmental stage).
•	It should not reproduce in grow-out ponds/tanks.
•	If it reaches sexual maturation relatively late, it is advantageous.
•	It should accept formulated food and grow well. 
•	It should be an efficient converter of economical foodstuffs.
•	If it is accidentally released to natural water bodies there should not be adverse
environmental impacts.
•	It should tolerate high population density and grow well
•	Having resistance to common diseases is advantageous.
•	It should satisfy consumers by the taste, nutritive value, texture of flesh or appearance/
body color/ color patterns. 

Ornamental fish culture

Ornamental fish keeping has been a hobby of humans for centuries of years; initially fish that had
some colours were collected from wild and maintained in garden ponds for the joy of watching
their aesthetic beauty. Ornamental fishes lure and draw a great attention worldwide through their
attractive coloration, shapes and sizes of body and fins, swimming behaviors, ability to live
under captive conditions and adaptability to live in little spaces. People keep fish in their homes
for variety of reasons such as for decoration, children’s education, enjoyment, relaxation of
elderly or health affected individuals, prosperity and fortune of home occupants and to collect
rare species and even to propagate them. Globally, ornamental fish keeping has emerged as one of
the most popular hobbies being second only to the photography.

Aquarium

An aquarium can be defined as a container that is designed to hold water in which living organisms
can be maintained over an extended period of time. Aquaria vary tremendously in size, shape and
design ranging from a simple bottle containing some water (e.g. an empty jam bottle is used to
keep a male Siamese fighting fish) to a multimillion Liters commercial exhibit tanks. 

Maintenance of a home aquarium
There are activities that should be carried out daily, weekly, fortnightly and monthly in order to
maintain environmental conditions (water quality parameters) within the optimum ranges for the
fish kept in an aquarium. Provision of correct nutrition and maintenance of water quality within
optimum ranges contribute for the well-being and health management of fish kept in an aquarium.
Daily:
1. Feed the fish with a nutritionally balanced diet following a correct feeding regime
(suitable daily ration should be offered in 2 or 3 meals)
2. Check on the status of health while feeding and remove the affected individuals for
treating in another tank/basin
3. Allowing fish to adapt for the changing intensity of light (to prevent unnecessary stress
on fish),
- Switch on the light of the aquarium several minutes after the room lights have
been on or after the day break
-Switch off the light of the aquarium several minutes before the room lights are switched
off or shortly before natural lights fades
Weekly:
1. Fish should not be fed one day per week (not applicable for brood fish, fry and fingerlings)
Fortnightly:
1. Switch off aeration
2. Rake or stir up gently the surface of the rooting medium (under-gravel filter medium)
3. Scrape excess algal growth
4. Allow debris to settle
5. Siphon off the debris along with 20 — 25% of the aquarium water
6. Replace the volume siphoned out with freshwater in which temperature, pH and
hardness match with conditions of the water in the aquarium
7. Switch on aeration

Monthly:
1. Take out some water from the aquarium in to a basin /another tank/ bucket
2. Collect the fish carefully using a hand net and introduce them into the basin/ tank/bucket
and arrange aeration to it.
3. Rinse rooting medium (under-gravel filter medium)
4. Remove the aeration tube from air lift, scrape off any deposit (algal or calcite) from the
opening and clean/scrape off air diffuser stones
5. Introduce the siphoning tube under the filter plates and suck out the accumulated organic
debris
6. Check the terminals of light source
7. Remove dead and dying leaves from plants
8. Prune, thin out and tidy the plants and replace poorly grown plants
9.Rearrange the filter plates and the filter medium
10. Arrange the aeration and fill the aquarium halfway with clean freshwater/aged aerated
tap water.
11. Reintroduce the fish with the water and then fill the aquarium to the original level of
water using aged clean freshwater
No matter how much time and care is devoted things in an aquarium could go wrong
from time to time. Equipment failure, excessive algal growth, poor water quality or
occurrence of diseases could be the cause.

Water turning into green frequently, green algae growing on plants on aquarium décor and on the
side glasses of the aquarium indicate that the aquarium is receiving too much light. The reduction
of intensity and/or duration of light followed by partial water exchange may prevent this situation.
Growth of brown algae as brown encrustations on plants on aquarium décor and on the side
glasses of the aquarium are indications of insufficient illumination. Blue-green algal “mats” on
plants on aquarium décor and on the side glasses of the aquarium indicate a high level of organic
pollution. Physical removal of algal mats followed by partial water exchange, a review of the
maintenance routine with a view to prevent further accumulation of organic pollutants (whether
too much food are offered to fish, inadequate filtration or aeration, overstocking, etc.) are required
to correct the situation. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
148,Applied Biology,"Common diseases of cultured, fresh water ornamental fish species ","Ornamental fish kept in aquaria are susceptible to numerous diseases. Some of the diseases are
infectious and some are non-infectious.
Infectious diseases
Invasion of fish tissues by a disease causing agent (a pathogenic virus, bacterium, fungus, or
an obligatory/ oppourtunistic parasite), multiplication of it in/on fish tissues and increasing its’
population may lead to the development of an infectious disease in ornamental fish. However,
many infectious diseases could be avoided/prevented through better management practices
(BMPs such as maintenance of water quality, correct stocking density of compatible fish with
compatible plants, correct feeding regime) to keep the immunity of fish at a higher level and
through correct bio-security measures (to prevent contamination by pathogens; Ex: quarantining
new fish, plants and other aquarium décor).

Common diseases of fresh water ornamental fish species:

Aquatic organisms are susceptible to various diseases caused by different groups of pathogens. Bacterial fin rot and gill rot are bacterial infections that affect the health of fish, while Haemorrhagic septicaemia and Columnaris disease are also caused by bacteria, leading to severe health issues. Fungal infections such as External mycosis are caused by fungi, which can adversely affect the skin and overall health of fish. Fish white spot disease, commonly referred to as ich disease, is caused by unicellular, external, obligatory parasites, leading to significant mortality in infected fish populations. Additionally, Trichodinosis is caused by unicellular, external, opportunistic parasites that can exploit weakened fish. Lastly, Gill and skin infestation occurs due to obligatory or opportunistic parasites, specifically gill flukes and skin flukes, which can result in respiratory distress and skin damage. Collectively, these diseases highlight the diverse range of pathogens affecting aquatic health, necessitating effective management and treatment strategies.

Environmental impact of ornamental fish culture

Some impacts of ornamental fish culture are beneficial while some could be harmful. The first
benefit of ornamental fish culture is species conservation, and production of species that are difficult
to obtain from the wild. Breeding and rearing of approximately 90% of freshwater ornamental
fish traded globally are done under captive conditions; there is some environmental benefit or
elimination of environmental damage via those breeding programs. The golden arrowana, and
tiger barb (Puntius tetrazona) are two species that have been conserved via ornamental fish
production. In addition to the sale of fish to hobbyists, fish are also being reintroduced to habitats
in which they have been eliminated.
Invasive ornamental fishes/aquatic plants that are accidentally escaped to natural environment
could affect a wide range of native organisms from zooplankton to mammals across multiple
levels of biological organizations ranging from the genome to the ecosystem.
With imported live fish non-indigenous disease causing agents may also come in to a country.
Haphazard use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and other chemicals as preventive/therapeutic
treatments and release of treated water (containing those medications) in to the natural environment
may cause antibiotic resistance/ resistance to chemicals used on pathogenic microorganisms
including human pathogenic bacteria.","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
149,Applied Biology,Nursery Management and Propagation,"Issues in Nursery Management

management (soil type, properties of soil and maintenances of soil), pest and disease control,
water management (water quality and quantity), nursery structures and environmental controls
(protected cultivation versus open air cultivation).
Management of light is a critical factor for rooting cuttings, seed germination, seedling growth as
well as in tissue culture facilities. Light can be manipulated by controlling, quality (wave length)
and duration (day length, photoperiod).
Soil management is a must to get a quality product. Soil texture, structure, and organic matter
content influence the soil condition. Soil condition can be improved via application of fertilizer
or manure into soil. 

Pest and disease control is vital to get a quality product and to maintain the plant health. This is
achieved via biological, cultural, physical, chemical or combination of these as integrated pest
management.
Water management and humidity control are also critical factors, which governs the rooting of
cuttings and regulation of plant growth. The type of irrigation used depends on natural conditions
of the area, soil type, slope of the land, water availability and the crop to be irrigated. Adequate
supply of good quality water is a must in a nursery.
During propagation and nursery management, nutrients are supplied to seedlings. Although there
are number of ways to apply fertilizer, the type chosen depends on the form of fertilizer available,
cultivated crop requirement and the environmental conditions prevailing. Fertilizer may be
applied as either solids or liquids.
Detailed description of nursery structures and protected cultivation is given in next section
In addition to these, other issues faced by growers are;
•	 Lack of access to modern technology
•	Lack of financial incentives to further improve the nursery and cultivation facilities
•	Shortage of quality planting/ propagating materials
•	Inadequate knowledge on suitable techniques and growth conditions that can be used
to grow crops

Methods and Rationale of Protected Cultivation of Crops/ Protected Agriculture

Horticultural crops can be grown in various types of plant growing structures. These structures
provide a more favourable environment for plants than the open air/ outdoor cultivation. In
simple terms protected cultivation is growing crops under controlled environmental conditions
(Fig. 10.1. A). Protected cultivation of horticultural crops will tremendously benefit in terms of
enhanced productivity.
Protected cultivation technology is used to protect plants from adverse climatic conditions (wind,

heavy rain, mist etc.) by providing optimum conditions to achieve maximum yield and the best
quality. This type of cultivation can be done in green house (depending on the covering materials
different structures are used such as polytunnels). Protected cultivation is mainly utilized to grow
perishable horticultural produce such as, fruits, vegetables and ornamental plant. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
150,Applied Biology,"Tissue Culture — Principle and its importance
","Tissue culture and micropropagation are two most interesting areas under biotechnology. In
general, cell or tissue culture is culture of free living cells or group of similar cells.
More specifically, tissue culture is the ability to establish plant tissues (cells, callus and protoplasts),
plant organs (embryos, shoots, roots) in aseptic, in vitro culture. The most common benefit of
tissue culture is that of cloning or mass production of genetically identical organisms.
The main concept behind plant tissue culture is “totipotent” 1.e., a single cell has the genetic

programme to grow into an entire new plant. The concept of totipotent was first introduced by the
scientists, Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann who postulated the “cell theory” in 1838.
A tissue culture medium generally consists of inorganic salts, organic substances, water and
gelling agent. Macro and micronutrients in appropriate ratios make the inorganic salt component.
The organic substances include carbon energy source (usually sucrose) plant growth regulators
(cytokinins and auxins), vitamins, miscellaneous compounds. Agar is incorporated as the gelling
agent. These gels provide physical support for the explant and increase the aeration of the medium.
There are several commercial media available for tissue culture (e.g. Murashige and Skoog or MS
medium, etc.).

Importance of tissue culture technique:
1. Rapid multiplication of clones
Mass propagation of specific clones
Genetic uniformity
Genotype modifications
Ability to produce plants in large numbers in a small space
Production of pathogen-free plants
All year around production of plants
Bo Saee
Ability to produce plants which do not produce viable seeds
Examples for tissue-cultured plants are Anthurium (Anthurium andreanum), Banan, Pineapple,
Dragon fruit.
Grafting and other propagation methods used in floriculture industry
Seed propagation method/ sexual propagation
The most common and widely used propagation method for plants is seeds. Therefore, production
of high quality seeds is a prime importance in the horticulture sector. Growers wish to have high
quality seeds with higher percentage of germination and higher viability and free of diseases and
pest damages.
Seed germination is the beginning of the next sexual generation of a particular plant. For a seed
to initiate germination following conditions must be completed.
1. The seeds must be viable
2. The seed must be subjected to suitable environmental conditions
3. Dormancies existing should be overcome
Anthrium and Orchid plants can be produced using seed propagation methods (At present tissue
culture is culture methods).

Vegetative propagation methods used in the Floriculture industry

In nature, some plants can produce sexually via seeds as well as asexually or vegetatively. In
vegetatively propagated plants, the new plant is nearly always genetically identical to the parent.
The various methods of vegetative propagation include separation and division, cuttings, layering
and grafting. Most of these vegetative propagations methods are used in the floriculture industry.

Separation and Division: Separation is a propagation method where naturally detachable
structures (e.g. Rhizomes, bulbs, and corms) are used. During division, it involves cutting or
dividing the plant into sections with both roots and stems (e.g. stolons and rooted runners). 

Cuttings: Cutting propagation is one of the most important clonal regeneration technique used
in horticulture industry (for ornamental plants, fruit trees). Adventitious root formation is a
prerequisite in this process. A piece of plant from the stem, leaf, root or leafy bud can generate
into a fully developed plant (Fig. 10.2). The roots arising from stem, leaf, or bud tissue are known
as adventitious roots. e.g. Roses, Ficus, Dracaena sp., African violets, Croton., Although stem
and leaf-bud cuttings need only a new adventitious root system to be formed, for root and leaf
cuttings, both the new shoot and root systems need to be formed.
Propagation via leaf cuttings: Begonia, African violet, snake plant (Sansevieria) 

Layering: A method of vegetative propagation, where stems are rooted while attached to the
parent plant. Some plants have a natural tendency to regenerate by self-layering, forming
adventitious roots from the stem where they touch the soil
(strawberry, Cynodon sp.). Layering technique is a good way
of getting small number of new plants with relative certainty
because the new plant is nourished by it’s parent plant until roots
are formed and rooted. 

Grafting: This involves joining two separate plants so that they later function as one healthy
plant that has the best characteristics of two parent plants. A root system is provided by one plant
(known as root stock or understock) and the desired top part by the other plant (known as scion)
e.g. Roses
During a graft union it is vital that the cambium of the scion is placed in close contact with
the rootstock cambium (Fig. 10.4). Initially a callus (mass of undifferentiated parenchyma cells)
bridge is formed between the scion and rootstock in a successful graft. These callus cells are
originated from the scion and the rootstock. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
151,Applied Biology,Food Preservation and Postharvest Losses,"Importance of food preservation

Most kinds of foods are readily spoiled unless they are preserved using suitable methods of
preservation. food preservation ensures that food could be stored for a particular period. During
some seasons over production of certain food occurs and the excess production could be preserved
(using suitable methods) and stored to be used later. Food preservation protects the food that is
available for human consumption reducing the “food loss”.

Food preservation

Food preservation is the process of treating and handling food to stop or greatly slow down
spoilage (loss of quality, edibility or nutritive value) caused or accelerated by micro-organisms.
Food could be preserved before undergoing spoilage using suitable techniques which could
prevent unnecessary wastage and contribute greatly to meet food requirement of growing
human population by,
•	eliminating avoidable losses
•	making more nutritive food items from low grade raw commodity using proper
processing and fortification,
•	diverting a portion of food materials presently being fed to animals for human
consumption by way of processing and
•	fortifying low grade food and organic wastes and by-products into nutritive animal feed.

Principles of Food Preservation

It is essential to prevent contamination of harvested food from damaging agents by hygienic
handling, transportation and storage.
Three basic principles of food preservation
•	 Prevention of entry of microorganisms into food (aseptic).
•	Prevention of the growth and activity of microorganisms in food.
•	Remove or killing of microorganisms in food. 

Methods of Food Preservation

Food preservation methods aim to prevent contamination in the first place and to remove or
reduce the numbers of contaminants. Preservation of food is achieved by application of
physical, chemical and/or biological methods. The techniques may be applied separately or in
combination. Microorganisms need a source of food and water, and they also need a suitable
pH and temperature to grow; one or several of the living conditions needed for the growth of
microorganisms have to be removed by the food preservation technique.
Drying
One of the oldest methods of food preservation is drying. Food is dried mostly in the sun and
drying reduces water activity of the food sufficiently to prevent or delay microbial growth
allowing food to keep for weeks. Most types of grains are dried to increase shelf life. Wheat,
corn, oats, rice, rye, and barley are left to dry to prevent spoilage. Hams are a great example of
meats preserved through drying in ovens.
Thermal (heat) Treatment
Heating food is an effective way of preserving it because the great majority of harmful
pathogens are killed at temperatures close to the boiling point of water. In this respect, heating
is a form of food preservation. A preliminary step in many other forms of food preservation,
especially forms that make use of packaging, is to heat the food to temperatures sufficiently
high to destroy pathogens. In many cases, food is actually cooked prior to their being packaged
and stored.","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
152,Applied Biology,Pasteurization,"Freezing and chilling
Freezing is perhaps the most common of all modern food preservation methods both.
commercially and domestically. Commercially freezing is done in different types of freezers
under extremely fast freezing or fast freezing (bringing the temperature of fish/meat down to
a value between -18 to -30 OC within 15 minutes to 2 hours) to preserve the quality. Frozen
products are stored in cold rooms (at -18 to -30 °C _) until distributed in order to prevent the
growth and spreading of spoilage microorganisms(the extreme cold prevent
microbial growth).
Storage of food (fruits, fruit juices, vegetables, fish, meat, etc.) in refrigerators at low temperatures (chilling at 4 to 7 °C) reduces the growth and activities of spoilage microorganisms, preserving food for a short period (for 10 to 14 days). 

Salting
Salting also is an older form of preserving raw foods. Salt has an ability to suck the moisture
out of food through the process of osmosis. When the food is totally dry from salting, growth
of microorganisms are inhibited. Meat is commonly preserved through salting.
Salting and drying
In preparation of dried fish (anchovy, tuna, etc.) fish are first salted and then dried in sun.
Addition of salt makes the removal of water fast and the salt inhibits microbial growth on fish
even though some moisture is still remaining in flesh.
Addition of Sugar (Sugaring)
Sugar is used in syrup form to preserve fruits and in crystallized form to preserve some food items
like ginger and orange peel. Some fruits are glazed with sugar syrup for the fruits to
get a superficial, protective coating. Some fresh fruits are cooked with sugar and then dried.
High sucrose concentration produces osmotic stress on microorganisms and protects the food
from microbial spoilage.
e.g. Jam, sugared toffees made with ash pumpkin
Smoking
Smoking is the process that cooks, flavors and preserves food exposing it to the smoke from
burning wood. Smoke is antimicrobial and antioxidant and most often meats and fish are
preserved by smoking. The aroma generated by hydrocarbons of burning wood
enhances the taste, flavour and adds smokiness to the meat/fish while preserving.
Chemicals
Chemicals inhibit growth and activity of microorganisms while some chemical compounds can
kill the microorganisms (e.g. preservation of fruit Juice and production of pickles using chemicals
such as sodium benzoate, EDTA, acetic acid, and brine solution).

Preservation of Food through radiation
The type of radiation used in processing food materials is limited to radiations from high energy
gamma rays, X-rays and accelerated electrons. Processing of food by radiation involves
exposure of food to short wave radiation energy to achieve a specific purpose such as extension
of shelf-life, insect disinfestation and elimination of food borne pathogens and parasites.
(e.g. packets of spices, ground meat, etc. 

Postharvest Losses
Food losses that occur along the food supply chain from harvesting of a crop until its consumption
is defined as postharvest losses.
Product quality at harvest is influenced by when and how the harvest is done; pre-harvest factors
such as source of seed and quality that has been set during growth also contribute for the product
quality at harvest. Product quality at harvest could be lost further during harvesting, handling,
transporting, storage, domestic processing and distribution.
The postharvest losses can broadly be categorized as,
•	 weight loss due to spoilage,
•	quality loss,
•	nutritional loss
•	seed viability loss and
•	commercial loss.

Postharvest losses in production of cereals (e.g. paddy) fruits and vegetables
During Harvesting - Untimely harvesting
Paddy should be harvested at the best time (considering the variety of paddy). Delayed harvesting
of paddy may result quality loss, nutritional loss, seed viability loss, weight loss and commercial
loss; those losses could be further increased if paddy fields are flooded due to heavy rains just
before harvesting. If paddy is harvested earlier it requires more drying (drying cost), grains with
high moisture content are susceptible to mold growth & insect infestation resulting broken grains
and low milling yield with significant commercial losses. In addition, depending on the method
of harvest, part of the paddy crop may be left and ploughed in to soil which is a commercial loss.
Fruits and vegetables also should be harvested at the best time (could vary with the variety) to
have maximum quality and to obtain the highest quantity; if harvested too early, the crop will not
be ripe/matured enough and if harvested too late it may spoil quickly leading to quality loss and
nutritional loss, finally resulting economical losses. Harvesting of fruits and vegetables should
be done without allowing physical/ mechanical damages to occur; if damages occur quality and
storage life will be reduced as spoilage microorganisms will quickly invade through damaged
areas.
During Handling
High shattering loss of paddy seed could occur which is a commercial loss. Harvested paddy
should be dried, bagged and stored temporarily without allowing the paddy seed to absorb
moisture and greater attacks by insects and rodents. 
In order to protect the quality, harvested fruits and vegetables should be handled hygienically kept
in plastic cartons which could be kept in a shade temporarily. Harvested fruits/vegetables should
be sorted to remove damaged, infested, moldy and over-ripe fruits / over-matured vegetables;
sorting will reduce spoilage during transport and storage.
Transportation
Poor road infrastructure along with improper and poorly maintained modes of transportation
results in large spillage of paddy seed and high contamination. Multiple movements of crop
is another major reason for high transportation losses. Sometimes bagged paddy is loaded and
unloaded from vehicles several times before it is milled. During each movement some grains are
lost as spillage. During handling and transportation of rice, 2 — 10% losses occur in Southeast
Asia. Those losses could be minimized using well planned, better mode of transportation with an
efficient bulk handling system.
During the transportation of fruits/vegetables arranged at the bottom of stacked crates could be
damaged by the weight of the produce kept above; use of crates that could be stacked without
putting the weight on produce at the bottom would solve this issue. Use of straw or something
soft in between layers of produce within a crate will reduce the damages due to rubbing. Rough
handling of crates containing produce should be avoided to prevent possible damages to the
produce. Uncontrolled changes of temperature and excessive shaking could do great damages to
the produce during transport. In tropical countries, if transportation is carried out at night time
produce could be protected by high temperature of the day time.
Storage
Storage plays a vital role in the food supply chain, although losses occur at each stage of the
supply chain from production to consumer level, storage losses are considered most critical in
developing countries as maximum losses occur during the storage. Generally, after harvesting/
milling, grains are stored for short or long periods of storage as food reserves, and as seeds for next

season. Poor storage infrastructure allows, rice to absorb excess moisture, rice grains with excess
moisture to be infested easily by insect pests followed by invasion of spoilage microorganisms,
rice to be attacked by rodents and other pests.
Provision of proper storage infrastructure could prevent/reduce the losses that occur during
storage of paddy/milled rice.
Uncontrolled changes of temperature could encourage spoilage microorganisms to grow faster
spoiling the stored produce (fruits and vegetables). Storage of fruits and vegetables should be
done in properly chilled rooms to reduce the rate of spoilage. 

Domestic processing
In domestic processing of different food types at different areas of Sri Lanka following methods
are used. The postharvest loss of food processing could be due to early harvesting, improper
handling, etc. Postharvest losses that could occur during domestic processing could be reduced
by following correct procedures (e.g. harvesting at the right time), hygienic handling to prevent
microbial contaminations and proper storage (to prevent attacks of insects, rodents, etc.).
Drying (paddy/rice and other cereals), drying after thermal treatment (jack fruit, etc.),
pasteurization (milk), freezing (fish and meat are temporarily stored in freezer compartment of
a refrigerator), chilling (fruits, vegetables, etc.), salting (lime, etc.), salting and drying (fish),
sugaring (homemade jams), use of chemicals (pickles) ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
153,Applied Biology,Dengue,"Dengue is a vector borne disease which is caused by an arbovirus which is a RNA virus. Epidemics
of dengue are reported in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The virus is transmitted by
two species of mosquitoes, they are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The transmission ofthe
dengue virus is dependent on biotic and abiotic factors. The biotic factors include the virus, the
vector and the host and the abiotic factors include temperature, humidity and rainfall. The dengue
virus is transmitted to human via the biting of an infected female mosquito. The infected humans
can be symptomatic as well as asymptomatic and they are the carriers and multipliers of the virus.
The Aedes mosquitoes are small to medium sized (approximately 4-7 mm) and it is dark in colour.
These mosquitoes have white markings/bands on its body and the arrangement on these bands
are different in the body and the legs. They live about 2-4 weeks depending on the environmental
conditions.

The life cycle has four stages, they are eggs, larva, pupa and adults. The adult female mosquito
lays eggs singly on the inner surface of wet containers above the water level, preferably clear
water.
Initially the laid eggs are white in colour and they become shiny black colour within few minutes
from deposition of the eggs. These eggs are smooth, long and ovoid in shape and about 1 mm
long. The eggs hatch within two days to become a larvae. The larvae rest with an angle to the
water surface. If the eggs are not hatched, they can undergo dormant for a period of about six
months. The body of larva consists of three major parts i.e. head, thorax and abdomen. After 4-5 days the larval stage becomes the pupa which is comma shaped and mobile. The pupa becomes
the adult mosquito within 1-2 days.
Breeding sites
The female mosquitoes lay eggs in a wide variety of artificial and natural wet containers. They
prefer dark colored surfaces with clear (unpolluted) water. The breeding sites can be found in
both indoor as well as outdoor. They include,
•	 discarded plastic containers- tins, clay pots, yoghurt and ice cream cups, bottles, cans,
damaged ceramic items, coconut shells, etc.
•	water storage containers such as cement tanks, barrels, etc.
•	discarded automobile tyres, and machinery parts,
•	building structures such as roof gutters, concrete slabs etc
•	household/ institutional appliances including refrigerator trays, flower vases, ornamental
ponds, squatting pans of wash rooms, etc
•	natural breeding sites such as leaf axils, tree holes, etc.

Symptoms of disease

Dengue can affect infants, young children and adults. It starts with flu-like symptoms. Sudden
onset of high fever (40 °C/ 104 °F) could be accompanied by any of the following symptoms.
They are severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, nausea, vomiting, or skin
rash. These symptoms usually last for 2-7 days after incubation period of 4-10 days from the bite
of an infected female Aedes mosquito.
Severe dengue (dengue hemorrhagic fever) is a potentially deadly complication due to blood
plasma leaking, fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or organ impairment.
Warning signs occur 3—7 days after the first symptoms in conjunction with a decrease in
temperature (below 38°C/100°F) and include: severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, rapid
breathing, bleeding from the nose and gums, fatigue, enlargement of liver reduced number of
platelets, restlessness and blood in vomit. The next 24—48 hours of the critical stage can be lethal,
in which symptoms may progress to massive bleeding, very low blood pressure, shock and death.

Proper medical care is needed to avoid complications and risk of shock and death (dengue shock
syndrome).
Controlling measures of the vector
The dengue vector controlling methods are mainly aimed at both immature and adult stage of the
Aedes mosquitoes. Integrated vector management strategy includes environmental, chemical and
biological controlling methods.
The most cost effective way is controlling the vector by eliminating its breeding sites. Removal of
open source of water through the environmental management could be done by 
•	 having continuous water supply to minimize storage of water in cement tanks, barrels,
and other containers,
•	making mosquito proofing of water storage cement tanks, domestic wells, and over head
tanks,
•	construction of buildings without roof gutters
•	removal of unserviceable roof gutters
•	regular cleaning with scrubbing of water storage tanks, flower pots, flower vases, ant
traps, refrigerator trays
•	proper disposal of solid wastes
•	proper storage of used tyres, household and garden utensils.

In addition to environmental management practices, biological controlling methods also can be
used to control the vector. They include,
use of fish species which feed on the larval stages of the mosquito. The following fish species
could be introduced to water storage tanks, barrels, ornamental ponds, etc. to feed on the larval
stages of these mosquitoes.
•	Guppy (Poecilia reticulata )
•	Dandi (Rasbora daniconius )
•	Juvenile stages of Tilapia

The Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) also can be used to control the dengue vectors. This
is a bacterium that produces an endotoxin which is toxic to the larval stages of the mosquitoes.
Another method of mosquito control is thermal fogging which is a form of chemical method.
When mosquitoes are exposed to sufficient dosage of this fog they are knocked down and killed.
There are several limitations in vector controlling methods, such as lack of sufficient knowledge
in biological controlling methods.
When fish are used to control the vector,
•	 fish could die in the absence of food in the breeding site and due to changes in water
quality parameters such as pH of water in breeding site
•	when the domesticated water containers are filled with chlorinated water it may lead to
the death of the fish.
when Bti is suggested to control the vector,
•	there could be some breeding sites that Bti can't be applied
chemical methods such as fogging,
•	could affect health of both humans and animals ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
154,Applied Biology,Filaria,"Lymphatic Filariasis in Sri Lanka

Filariasis is one of the oldest debilitating disease in the world. This is one of the major leading
causes of permanent and long term disability. It does not kill people, but cause permanent disability.
Filariasis is a mosquito borne disease transmitted by a thread like nematode, who lives in human
lymphatic system. The disease is endemic in developing countries with poor socio-economic
status and is often associate with poor environment sanitation. Filaria has been categorized as a
neglected tropical disease.
Parasite
•	 90% of infections are caused by Wuchereria bancrofti
•	Human is the exclusive host of W. bancrofti
Vector
•	In Sri Lanka it is transmitted solely by Culex quinguefasciatus mosquito
•	Culex breeds in polluted water bodies; blocked drains, broken toilet pits, husk pits etc.
The Culex mosquito is small to medium in size (3 to 4 mm in length) and grey-black in colour.
The nervures of wings of adult mosquito are beset with brown or blackish scales and the posterior
margin of the wings is fringed with bristle and scales. Female lay eggs in the form of egg rafts
that floats on the surface of water. After hatching, larva rests keeping its body with an angle to the
water surface.

Factors associated with transmission
•	 Transmission in a community is influenced by
•	Number of infected persons (prevalence)
•	Density of microfilaria in blood of infected persons
•	Density of vector mosquitoes
•	Characteristics of the vector (affects development of larvae)
•	Frequency of human vector contact

Methods of transmission
Filariasis parasite is introduced to human body by a bite of a female adult mosquito. When the
mosquito suck blood from humans, larval stages of parasite falls on to the skin (do not inoculate
in to the body as other mosquito borne disease agents). Then these larvae penetrate skin through
the bite wound and enter into the human vascular system. From here, the larvae migrate to the
lymphatic system. Within one year larvae become matured in to adult worms. Adult male and
female worms nests and mate in lymphatic vessels and produce large number of tiny, immature 
eggs which hatch into microfilariae. Microfilariae migrate from the lymphatic system and enter
the blood stream. Microfilariae live in lungs during day time and travel to peripheral blood during
night. From here they transfer to mosquito when it takes a blood meal from human body.
Ingested microfilariae transform into several larval forms and again with another bite enter into
human body.
Adult worm lives in lymphatic system for 5-6 years and microfilaria can lives for | year.
When adults worms block lymphatic vessels they get distorted and lymph flow does not occur
smoothly. Lymph tends to accumulate in dependent parts of the body: legs, hands, testes, penis,
and breast causing lymphedema. When microfilaria lives in lungs patients develop dry cough,
wheezing, mild fever, weight loss etc.
Fluid accumulation in scrotum manifests as hydrocele. Presence of microfilariae in lungs manifest
as occult filariasis. Occult filariasis is characterized by high eosinophilic count with chronic cough
and wheezing which worsen at night with dyspnea, chest pain, fever and weight loss.
Clinical manifestations vary from asymptomatic to chronic lymphedema (elephantiasis).
After entering the human body the filarial parasite (L3 larva) develops into an adult worm
and remains silent in lymphatics for several years producing microfilaria. These patients are
asymptomatic and can only be detected through active surveillance.
Presence of adult parasite in lymphatic system for a longer period gives rise to late manifestations.
They are due to dilatation of lymphatic vessels followed by their dysfunction, accumulation of
fluid in tissues and increased risk of infection (lymphoedema). With recurrent infections skin of
oedematous extremities becomes thickened and later on gives rise to warty, nodular, papillomatous
appearance. Lymphoedema is graded according to the state of oedema and appearance of the skin
Controlling measures
•	Personal protection from mosquito bites/ prevent mosquito bites by the use of mosquito
nets, repellants, long sleeve shirts and trousers.
•	Elimination of breeding sites: repair broken septic tanks, cleaning drainages, prevent
dumping garbage in to drains, chemical control of aquatic plants in water reservoirs
•	Prevent creation of breeding sites
•	Use of larvivorous fish such as guppy, nalahandaya in water bodies.
•	Screening healthy population with night blood films and detect people who harbor the
infection but do not show any symptoms and treat them.
•	Monitor vector mosquito population for infectivity 

Limitations of controlling methods
Lack of sufficient knowledge among people about the disease, the vector, method of transmission,
breeding sites and controlling measures. ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
155,Applied Biology,Nanotechnology,"Nanotechnology is an emerging science involved in designing, building and manipulating
minute structures at the nanometer level. A nanometer (nm) is one billionth of a meter (10° m).
Nanotechnology is the creation and use of materials and devices on the same scale as molecules
and intracellular structures, typically less than 100 nm in size. The physical and chemical properties
of tiny molecules are significantly different than bigger particles as they have a very high surface
area to volume ratio.
American Physicist Richard Feynman in 1959 enlightened the world on nanotechnology.
Living organisms are built of cells that are typically 10 um across. However, the subcellular
organelles are much smaller. Proteins are even smaller with a typical size of just 5 nm, which is
comparable with the dimensions of smallest manmade nanoparticles. This simple size comparison
gives an idea of using nanoparticles as very small probes that would allow us to investigate
the cellular machinery without introducing too much interference. Understanding of biological
processes on the nanoscale level is a strong driving force behind development of nanotechnology.
Nanotechnology has now become a big business with applications in material manufacturing,
energy, electronics and engineering. But Applications of nanoparticles in biology and medicine
are of particular interest. One of the most important applications of nanotechnology is in
medicine. Applications of nanotechnology for improving human health are termed Nanomedicine.
Nanotechnology can be applied for prevention diagnosis and treatment of diseases.
Titanium dioxide (TiO,) and silver (Ag) nanoparticles are used for sterilization of operation theatres
and surgical instruments in hospitals. These nanoparticles are able to destroy the microbes. Silver
nano lotions are applied in theatres to prevent the entry of microbes. Nano particles are used in
the production of antimicrobial coatings and nano - filters. TiO, and Silver nano filters prevent the
entrance of tiny particles such as viruses. These nano filters are used to examine SARS patients.
Nano device sensors are used to monitor blood pressure; blood oxygen levels and hormone
concentrations. Nano particles can unclog blocked arteries and detect and eliminate cancer cells.
Several nanotechnology enabled drugs are available in the market primarily in areas of cancer
treatment. Scientists have developed “smart drugs” using tiny nanoparticles such as gold particles
that are introduced into the body to seek out and target special cells such as cancer cells to deliver
a cargo that would destroy those that are damaged rapidly and effectively in a silent manner with
very few side effects. 

pherical nanoparticles consisting of a dielectric core called nano shells are used in the treatment
of cancer. A nano shell is slightly bigger than a polio virus. Gold nano shells are used in bio
imaging enhancements as well.
In the treatment of diabetes a Nano device is attached to the body which can release the required
dosage of insulin at required time intervals.
There has been successful application of nano-technology to the treatment and management of
pain both in clinical and experimental studies like the fabrication of nano-formulated liposomes
to deliver drugs for pain therapy.
Since nanocarrier systems can be easily transferred to the airways, many respiratory diseases can
be treated using nanotechnology.
Viva gel is a vaginally applied microbicide in development for prevention of HIV and HSV
(Herpes simplex virus). Viva gel is a product of nanotechnology which prevents the entry of HIV
and HSV during sexual intercourse.

156,Applied Biology,Stem Cell Therapy,"Stem cells are undifferentiated cells which can give rise to cells of the same type. They can
divide by mitosis without a limit (or at least for the lifetime of the animal). They are capable of
terminally differentiating into other cell types.
Stem cells are required wherever there is a recurring need to replace differentiated cells that
cannot themselves divide. The stem cell itself has to be able to divide but it doesn’t necessarily
have to divide rapidly. In fact, stem cells usually divide at a relatively slow rate.
Stem cells are of two types.
1. Embryonic stem cells
2. Adult Stem cells

1. Embryonic stem cells
Following fertilization of a sperm and an egg cell, the fertilized egg is called a zygote. The zygote
divides rapidly. In humans, in around five to seven days after fertilization, the dividing cells create
an embryo consisting of a small hollow cluster of approximately 100 cells called a blastocyst.
The blastocyst is approximately a seventh of a millimeter in diameter. There is a small cluster of
around 30 cells tucked inside the blastocyst that form a structure known as the inner cell mass.
These cells are the source of embryonic stem cells (ES cells )

S cells are so special because they can eventually differentiate to form all of the more than 200
cell types that make up the human body. Therefore, ES cells are called pluripotent because they
have the potential to develop into a variety of different cell types. Human ES cells (hESCs) are
unspecialized cells with two major properties.
e ES cells can self-renew indefinitely to produce more stem cells
e Under the proper growth conditions, hESCs can differentiate into a variety of mature
cells with specialized functions
2. Adult stem cells
Adult stem cells are found throughout the body after development. Adult stem cells are present
in many tissues. There are many types of adult stem cells specialized for the genesis of different
classes of terminally differentiated cells and hence each type of stem cell serves for the renewal
of one particular type of tissue.
Eg. Epidermal stem cells for epidermis, Intestinal stem cells for intestinal epithelium, hemopoietic
stem cells for blood, neural stem cells for central nervous system
Stem cells can be isolated and cultured in culture media in vitro. When adult stem cells are
removed from the body and maintained in culture or are transplanted from one site in the body to
another, they generally remain faithful to their origins. This creates practical limitation of using
adult stem cells for tissue regeneration.
In contract, ES cells can be kept proliferating indefinitely in culture and yet retain unrestricted
developmental potential. If ES cells are put back into a blastocyst, they become incorporated into
the embryo and can give rise to all the tissues and cell types in the body, including germ cells.
Under the proper growth conditions, human ES cells can differentiate into a variety of mature
cells with specialized functions in vitro.

There are ethical concerns of obtaining human embryonic stem cells. Therefore, research on
hESC is very controversial because of their source- an early embryo.
In late 2006, Scientists demonstrated the successful derivation of pluripotent stem cells from
adult tissues by reprogramming human cells taken directly from a volunteer. These are known
as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Pluripotent stem cells hold promise in the field of
regenerative medicine because they can propagate indefinitely, as well as give rise to every other
cell type in the body (such as neurons, heart, pancreatic, and liver cells), they represent a single source of cells that could be used to replace those lost to damage or disease. Since iPSCs can be
derived directly from adult tissues, they not only bypass the need for embryos, but can be made
in a patient-matched manner, which means that each individual could have their own pluripotent
stem cell line.

Applications of stem cells

There are many potential applications of stem cells from growing healthy tissues to studying them
to understand and treat birth defects to genetic manipulation for delivering genes in gene therapy
approaches. Creating whole tissues in the laboratory using tissue engineering is another potential
application for repairing tissues such as damaged heart muscles and damaged spinal neurons.
Blood stem cells (hemopoietic stem cells) taken from the bone marrow of healthy immunologically
compatible donor can be used to replenish bone marrow of patients with leukemia
Scientists believe that stem cell technologies will play key roles in developing treatments for
diseases such as stroke, heart disease, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, diabetes and many

157,Applied Biology,The Human Genome project,"The human genome has been the focus of biological research for the last two decades and will
continue to be the center of attention for many years to come. It is a worldwide effort to identify all
human genes of each chromosome along with several other goals. The human genome project is
an enormous undertaking in genomics that is providing scientists with exciting insight into human
genes, their locations and functions. It was originally a 13 year project (1990-2003) coordinated
by the US Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health. Additional contributions
came mainly from UK, Japan, France, Germany, Australia and China.
The aims of the project were to
1. Identify all the genes (approximately 20,000 protein coding genes) in human genome
2.Determine the sequences of the 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA
3.Store information in data bases

4.Improve tools for data analysis
5.Transfer related technologies to private sector

6.Address, ethical, legal and social issues that may arise from the project.
A major quality assessment of the human genome sequence was published in 2004 indicating over
92% of sampling exceeded 99.99% accuracy which was within the intended goal.
The Genome Reference Consortium (GRC) which is an international collective of academic and
research institutes with expertise in genome mapping is still working on the analyses of the data
obtained from the Human genome project. 

he sequencing of the human genome holds benefits for many fields, from molecular medicine
to human evolution. Improved diagnosis of various diseases, identification of mutations linked to
different forms of cancer, the design of medication and more accurate prediction of their effects,
gene therapy and control systems for drugs, Study of human evolution and anthropology are some
of them.
Another proposed benefit is the commercial development of genomics research related to DNA
based products, a multibillion-dollar industry.
The Human Genome Project, and the other genome projects such as Escherichia coli, yeast,
mouse, Arabidopsis thaliana, and rice have already been completed. This has therefore opened
the way to a comprehensive description of the molecular activities of human cells and the ways
in which these activities are controlled. This is central to the continued development, not only
of molecular biology and genetics, but also of those areas of biochemistry, cell biology and
physiology now described as the molecular life sciences.
The genome projects will have additional benefits that at present can only be guessed at. It is
evident that the human genome, in common with the genomes of many other organisms, contains
extensive amounts of intergenic DNA. It was thought that most of the intergenic DNA has no
function except occasionally it is known that some intergenic DNA acts to control genes nearby.
Could the intergenic DNA have a role, but one that at present is too subtle for us to grasp?
Though little is known about them, they are thought to have regulatory functions. The first step in
addressing this possibility is to obtain a complete description of the organization of the intergenic
DNA in different genomes, so that common features, which might indicate a role for some or all
of these sequences, can be identified ","Biology, Grade 13 (Unit 9 & 10 ), Resource Book"
